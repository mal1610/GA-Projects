## Text Classification of Legitimate & Computer Generated Amazon Reviews
*Can machines fight machines?*

### Background
---


In the United States, more than 80% of consumers indicate they use online reviews before [purchasing a product](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/PI_2016.12.19_Online-Shopping_FINAL.pdf). As reviews are among the most influential factors on consumers' buying behavior, fraudulent actors are tempted to hire writers who specialize in or use automated methods for generating fake reviews to enhance the attractiveness of their products and services. Technological progress in text generation – natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to be more specific – has incentivized the automation of fake reviews, as with generative language models, fake reviews could be generated at scale and a fraction of the cost compared to human-generated fake reviews.


Studies have shown that:
>* 76% of U.S. consumers trust online reviews as much as [recommendations from family and friends](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey)
>* An extra star on a restaurant's Yelp rating can [increase revenue by 5% to 9%](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/12-016_a7e4a5a2-03f9-490d-b093-8f951238dba2.pdf)


With ecommerce being forecast to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about [7.4 trillion dollars by 2025](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales), this may incentivize bad actors to perpetuate this fradulent act and the problem of fake reviews may prove to be persistent.


This project explores Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models to build a binary classifier to identify computer-generated Amazon Reviews
