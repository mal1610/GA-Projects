7,football,"Ive always wondered, cos theyve had genuinely good  transfer policies in finding cheap or medium priced players and getting the best out of them. Specially like how their two seemingly random Czech imports have come in and been great. I also like how they give time to their signings to bloom.

Even Haller who never kicked on was decent and wasnt just released on a huge loss. Well 20million isnt that small a loss but hes the only one alongside Yarmolenko that i can remember flopped (being a big signing), and one was mostly due to injuries.

Of course theyve had some flaws and flops as i mentioned but in general their transfer policy seems super solid for a midtable club with okay/decent backing, and i was thinking whoever is in charge of that has probably seen their stock go way up.",Who is in charge of transfers in West Ham?

58,football,"Inter fan here and my bias is that I've admired Mourinho ever since he led us to that famous treble in 2010.

I'm curious as to why so many fans, pundits and journalists speak about Mou as though he is washed up (for example: [https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/11/toxic-endgame-looms-for-jose-mourinho-as-doom-cycle-comes-round-ever-quicker](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/11/toxic-endgame-looms-for-jose-mourinho-as-doom-cycle-comes-round-ever-quicker) and [https://football-italia.net/mourinho-parked-the-bus-now-throws-roma-players-under-it/](https://football-italia.net/mourinho-parked-the-bus-now-throws-roma-players-under-it/)). It is true that he has not been winning Champions League and league trophies in recent years, but maybe he is being criticised on the basis of his ego and attitude as 'a special one'? In my opinion, many have taken his recent slump out of context.

*The context (or my understanding of it, anyways)*:

During his second stint at Chelsea he won the Premier League and the League Cup in his second season. Granted, the third season went downhill and Mou should have publicly and privately handled certain matters better (e.g., Eva Carneiro and the physio going onto the pitch). They started to lose many matches too. But, overall, this period was not a failure. Conte similarly won the Premier League and FA Cup with Chelsea before things went a little downhill there too, yet I think he received less scrutiny because he wasn't Mourinho and wasn't expected to win a Champions League every season.

With Man Utd, Mou won the League Cup, Europa League, and (if you want to count it) the Community Shield. Hardly a failure, though their last season with him was admittedly depressing. Mou perhaps could have made smarter buys but Ed Woodward wasn't exactly the best chief exec. either and the problems at United clearly go far deeper than their players and manager. Utd's problems go on till this day. Gary Neville defended Mou constantly when he was Utd's manager but recently complained about Mou's tenure while defending Ole. Great, so Neville preferred the vibe under Ole when they won nothing to Mou's time when they actually won trophies and came second to a much superior Man City team that got 100 points.

While Mou's time at Spurs could plausibly be considered a failure, let's not forget that Levy sacked him right before the Carabao Cup final. Who knows if they could have won it. It is a fact that the last time Spurs won a trophy was in 2008.

Now Mou is only 5-6 months into his first season at Roma who, with all due respect, need better players and are running a long-term project, and several 'experts' are already suggesting he's not up to it.

Granted, the 'public' aspect of his man-management might need fixing, such as when criticises his players publicly. This strategy might have worked in the past with the 'old guard' but, from a football fan's (and perhaps even a footballer's) perspective, it doesn't come off well at all these days.

Yes, I am defending Mou - probably even at a fanboy level here. But I think that the context of his jobs in recent years has been significantly overlooked.

What do you think?",The context of Mourinho's recent jobs has been largely ignored.

**-----------------------------------------**

In the third round of the FA Cup, Manchester United will welcome Aston Villa to Old Trafford on Monday night.

**Manchester United**

Manchester United was defeated 0-1 by Wolves in last round of the Premier League, and their 8-game unbeaten streak in all competitions was ended, which may beat their morale greatly. In addition, there is rumor that as many as 11 people have the idea of leaving the team. This is undoubtedly worse for the current form of Manchester United.

**Aston Villa**

Aston Villa has rebounded since Steven Gerrard coached the team, but unfortunately, after the impact of the Covid-19, the team has also suffered the problem of incomplete lineups.They have suffered defeats in last 2 rounds.

119,football,"Since 2012, Bayern has won every edition of this league. And they also won 2 trebles since then so they aren't going anywhere. Since 2012, Monaco and Lille (somehow) managed to dethrone PSG twice. And in Serie A, Juve have fallen and Inter has risen, and the new competition of Atalanta and reborn AC Milan has made it a fun-ish league. But Bayern are ruthless. The awful thing is the 50+1 rule imo. Say what you want about oil billionaire owners, at least they make the league competitive. the top 4 monopoly made man utd and arsenal dominate the prem which made it so boring. but chelsea and man city now becoming filthy rich makes the top 4 battle more exciting. Tradition is zero compared to more entertainment. Bayern is able to twist the Bundesligas rule however, and buy every good player and even COACH in the league. it is a monopoly and the absolute worst thing is that no bundesliga team can do anything about it, not even dortmund. not taking anything away from bayern, they are probably the best run club in the world. they make some of the smartest transfers and rarely go on shopping sprees, but the bundesliga is the WORST top 5 league in Europe.",What is the least competitive top 5 league in your opinion?

195,football,"First of all, I am not discrediting the legendary stats and greatness of these 4 players. However, to ay they are the four BEST soccer players to have ever lived I think is weird because they were only good at attacking. They can't defend, be a full back, or be a goalkeeper. Wouldn't the best soccer player be good at all of the positions of the game and be able to play all of those at a world class level. This is why I think that Alfredo di Stefano is the actual Number 1. Player of all time. From what I heard he could play literally every position on the pitch minus goalie. His contributions in that level led to him playing a huge part in tremendous club success with Madrid. Same could be kind of with Arturo Vidal (I am not comparing Vidal to di Stefano, I know the difference in legacy, but bear with me on this). Vidal could attack quite well, and defend. There is an article on this from Bleacher Report. What do you think. Would the best soccer player be considered the guy who can play EVERY position best on the field relative to their regular position, or the guy who can play his own position the best in the world and better (more effectively) than others who are the best in their positions. Like, Messi was the best attacker in 2019, and VVD was the best CB. But Messi was comparatively speaker a better and more effective attacker than VVD a defender. So, yeah.","Can we really call players like Messi, Ronaldo, Pele, or Maradona the greatest soccer players of all time if the only positions on the field they were good at were ST, LW, RW, LM, RM, or CAM?

233,football,"I felt this may have been discussed here before but Owens legacy here seems very much like a trials and tribulation type situation. Based on his goals and contributions it should be enough for him to be recognised as a club legend but his flirting of clubs like Real and attitude of thinking he wanted pastures anew didn't help his case.

I never saw much of his playing career in Liverpool but based on his accomplishments he should've been seen as a hero but instead a villain for how he handled his departure. He was a bench warmer at Madrid and Injury prone at Newcastle. His move to Man U is what ultimately soured him for me. Couldn't understand why he couldn't stay, not everyone succeeds at Real.

239,football,Look I don't hate forward but we need to understand the fact that there are 11 players on the ground in every different position but every year a forward wins it and onces in a blue a midfielder suddenly comes in and wins it. Correct me if I'm wrong out of 65 ballon d'or given only 1 goalkeeper and 3 defender and like 5 midfielders ( I'm not counting CAM because indirectly they are also a forward ) bruh they created a whole new trophy for the best goalkeeper (Yashin Trophy) which clearly shows us that a goalkeeper will never win a Ballon d'Or. How long after they create a new award for the best defender of the year and then the best midfielder of the year. Then the Ballon Dor will be totally for the forwards only because the best in other postion Will be given there respected positions award. And then they are making the ceremony more forward centric like they created a whole new award Named best striker of the year award like wtf üòÇ.  That's why I call it *forward d'or*,Don't y'all think that all this ballon d'or stuff is totally getting biased around forwards year after year

Treble in Spain and 
Domestic treble in England
Domestic league dominance in Spain, Germany, and England (In probably the strongest Premier league ever) 

The philosophy and style of play are genius. It‚Äôs almost painful to watch his teams sometimes because even though the players are brilliant 80% of the goals feel like they should be credited to him and his management, the system produces goals. 

He innovates like no other manager I‚Äôve seen. Like everyone else is trying to work in the current meta and he‚Äôs breaking things down to first principles and building soccer up again. 

The only thing I can hold against him right now is that after that initial stint with Barcelona he‚Äôs struggled in Europe. If I‚Äôm being honest, and it pains me to say this, he consistently beat Sir Alex in the Champions League head to head against some of the best United teams ever. mourinho was obviously spectacular in European competitions and Ancelotti has won 3 champions leagues. I think European success is the only argument against Guardiola right now and if he wins one more I‚Äôm willing to say he‚Äôs the best. 

TLDR; 

Guardiola needs one more Champions League to be almost indisputably viewed as the best modern manager.",If Pep Guardiola wins the Champions League with Manchester City will he be regarded as the best modern manager?

Alright, so the deciders for the last three spots are three months away, but I still want to post this now, because in march I‚Äôll be crying about how Everton will get smashed again in the second half of the Merseyside Derby. 

First, Playoff path A

Wales v Austria

The Welsh drew 0-0 to Estonia. That should be unforgivable in its own right. However, they then went on to get some kind of result against Belgium at Badouin. (how does the saying go? There‚Äôs nothing more certain than life, death, Norwich getting relegated, Mason Mou nt saving Chelsea from an embarrassing result, and Wales avoiding two losses against Belgium?)

Austria‚Ä¶yes, they did force Italy into extra time, and get promoted to League A, but they then also went on to lose 5-2 to Israel and finished 4th in their group *below* Israel. They were a point away from conceding their playoff spot to Hungary.

Let‚Äôs look at their teams. 

Wales has an exciting new generation. Sure, they might not seem like they can smoothly fit in to prime Aaron Ramsey/Ashley Williams levels of performance, but this was also a side that was a first touch and red card away from drawing to an Italian side that seemed unbeatable at the time. (also beating everyone‚Äôs dark horse picks 2-0, but you don‚Äôt like to talk about that). I believe that Daniel James could be a perfect replacement for Gareth Bale given the right choice of development. What about Austria? Does David Alaba still seem exciting to any of you? What about Marko Arnautovic? A Montengrin in an Austria shirt insulting an Albanian-born North Macedonian player‚Äôs mum because he doesn‚Äôt like the fact that Kosovo exists? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve found another striker by now, because that‚Äôs just unacceptable. Give me a name that stands out in the Austrian team, and I‚Äôll consider giving you chance.

Anyway here‚Äôs what I think will be the result

**Wales 1-0 Austria**

Yep, the strong, youthful Welsh side with home advantage will easily overpower an Austrian team that had a dismal showing the first part of World Cup Qualifying.

Scotland v Ukraine

This is one of the harder ones. The Scottish came out of their group with flying colors, beating Denmark at Hampden Park (however, qualification was already a given at the point, so the Danes called up a bunch of kids and old men that international break). Ukraine meanwhile, had taken sweet revenge in a draw against France, but then drawing to Kazakhstan in the same window. If you want to go by Euro 2020 performances, Ukraine would highly outclass the Scots, Hampden Park be damned. However, this Scottish side has pulled in much better results than their time in EURO 2020, and look to be named a golden generation. Ukraine, however, has more experience on this stage and is fighting for consecutive spots at a World Cup. I am leaning more towards an exciting Scottish side, however, but I believe it will be close battle, so here‚Äôs my result

**Scotland (4) 1-1 (3) Ukraine**

Yes, it will take penalties, and it‚Äôll be who‚Äôs more up to the fight: Craig Gordon/David Marshall or Bushchan, and I think a David Marshall still smarting from his humiliation to Patrik Schick‚Äôs lob will be extra determined to not let as few spotkicks pass as possible. 

Then it comes to the final: Wales v Scotland

I‚Äôve already ranted about my opinion. I love the Welsh team, I took an interest in their rise to relevance when Gareth Bale put that free kick in the back of Joe Hart‚Äôs net, and started supporting and taking interest in them, instead of the detached millionaires of the 2016 English side (while I‚Äôm from New Orleans, my father‚Äôs side of the family is English, and I was in the British Isles during that tournament). I have a more personal relationship with Wales. I vividly remember watching the Wales-Belgium game in my uncle‚Äôs apartment in Edinburgh, and then almost coming to tears watching Cristiano Ronaldo rise above the crowd to put the deciding goal past Wayne Hennessey, and Nani double the tally 3 minutes later at a campsite outside of Alnwick. Why did Portugal‚Äôs only decisive match of the tournament have to be against the Welsh??? This is a team that proved everyone wrong when they tipped Wales to be the tournament failures in EURO 2020. I have to lean towards a Scottish victory, but please prove us wrong again Wales!

Anyway, here‚Äôs the result:

**Wales 2-3 Scotland**

They managed similar results ranging from Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole. They had moments of brilliance but overall they were inconsistent in each year. It makes you wonder if any manager can work miracles and make them win something big. Honestly there are only 2 maybe 3 managers who would deserve the money and they are the less likely: Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel. Other than that, maybe even Zidane but I'd say he would be a risky choice since he only trained prime Real Madrid. I don't know man, I just feel that United have too many overpaid and overhyped players to turn up every game. Just look at Thiago Silva for example. He's 37 and he s playing 2 times more committed than Maguire. Even Phil Jones plays with more passion than him. But he's made captain and justifies a place in the starting lineup due to the fact that he was hella expensive and that's pretty much it.

373,football,"I think Holland may go far in world cup. Since they weren't very succesful for a long time, many forgot about them. In EURO's, they lost to Czech Republic who is a weaker team than Holland because of which many fans were dissapointed. 

However, their team is strong and because of lack of success they are probably very motivated to do something in Qatar. Final of Nations League vs Portugal is a success to mention. They've also beaten France, England and Germany twice. 

They have probably the best defender in the world today - Van Dijk. De Jong is one of the best central midfildiers with great ability to get a ball from defence to attack, Wijnaldum is a world class player who won everything with Liverpool, Depay plays very well in Barca, Dumfries was very good at EURO.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/q82k2r/goalpoint_ballon_dor_2021_the_compared_analytics/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Messi is better than lewa at everything other than goals that he scored in a competition they won 10 times in last 10 years . Lewa won nothing meaning last year while Messi won the Copa America while being the best in the tournament . There was another post showing how Messi was 99% in more stats than the whole other top attackers combined . 


Messi won the Copa America and Cdr and carried the team and made them compete In the league till the last day . What did Lewa do except score goals in a competition where the level is obviously way lower than laliga . Now don't say they won bundesliga cause Bayern have won it for the last 10 season or so without fail and I'm pretty sure they can win it with morata instead.  

People are acting like this is some kind of robbery which it's clearly not . Everyone knows he was robbed off 2020 balon d'Or but that doesn't give anyone the right to say Messi winning the balondor is robbery cause we all know Messi IS the better player and had better season winning the Copa and carrying the poor Barcelona team .",Why is everyone being a hypocrite ?

405,football,"Hello, I think I should start of by saying I have no experience watching any sports. My dad is a heavy sports fans and loves watching American football and football (soccer); but he never passed that hobby to me. He did make me play many sports growing up but stopped when it was clear that it wasn't for me. My parents are from Chile and I was born in the U.S. so soccer is tied to my family pretty deep. I just have no clue where to start and my dad will just think I am wasting his time asking about this. I was always the quiet and indoors type growing up, and would rather spend my day reading, playing video games, or draw. This is probably why my dad gave up sports on me but this isn't the thread for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start following a sport and football is probably the sport since its the one that gets talked a lot in my family and at work. I just don't know where to start and how to start watching. I'm starting to watch YouTube videos on the different types of leagues and the rules associates with those. Which is baffling to me because I thought all sports follow the same' rules associated to that sport.

&amp;#x200B;

Also have no clue on which team to follow, who the big players are, game schedules, and all the tournaments and where to find them.

406,football,"So I‚Äôm a fan of United. But I mean after Ferguson left it was a real rough r couple of years surf mediocrity at best and no clear direction. By no fault of anyone. The squad had aged not to gracefully and Ferguson left exactly at the right time to do so. I don‚Äôt blame his successors and what happened afterwards was natural, same situation as Barca is in right now, the most important pieces left and were never really substituted. Iniesta/xavi/Messi (how do you replace those? Is it even possible)

Anyways, flash forward until mourinho takes over and places United second place. Great!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Great? 

It‚Äôs a outdated football with defensive minded games and not at all what current football is heading towards. So out with the old and in with Ole!‚Ä¶. Ol√©

Now let‚Äôs be honest he really helped structure that team and keep ‚Äòem floating and doing real damn good and there is finally a plan and a direction of sorts that has been missing at United, which was when sir Alex left.

But here is the catch, de gea loses his mojo, f***** up so bad you don‚Äôt know in or out, de gea wanted to leave, but United wanted him to stay ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and no one can make a single penalty in United at that point, it was the most amazing thing, seeing players missing penalty after penalty, like bro, you are a professional, how do you miss it all all the time? 
United just seems out of synch, but every second half comeback is more amazing than the other. I mean my god, theater of
Dreams? Not even Hollywood could script it that good. 

The. Flash forward to how suddenly no one on untied can play any football, but guess who is saving United time and time again with flashy saves? Yupp, de gea. It‚Äôs like this Dr Jekyll and me Hyde going ok, and no one can seem to decide if United is a good or a bad team. My United Heart was set at this was the year everything would turn around, and now more than ever more stars are in United and should be clicking on all cylinders‚Ä¶ Right? And the only one able to Pull his weight is de gea, no one else has really impressed (Ronaldo is Ronaldo, but it‚Äôs clear he has created some big rifts in the team, ps I love Ronaldo, but he has, let‚Äôs not deny that). And top of all this, we have two idiot center backs that even lower the quality so much that even a world renowned defender such as varane is starting to look like a pile of hot garbage real quick. 

Well‚Ä¶ sorry for the rant, but I wish United could get their shit together and have the galacticos team that they are on paper in real life, I mean no one is as Stacked on each and every position as United is (should) be right now.

I understand the free-kick is very well taken, and even if the keeper had jumped, it probably still would have been a goal. But I find it a bit strange that the goalkeeper doesn't even make an attempt to jump and just watches the ball fly in instead.

I'm just genuinely curious as to why this happens, especially in free-kick situations. I can understand that, during open-play, there could be many variables that may cause the goalkeeper to freeze, such as the unexpected timing of the shot, or failing to react to a deflection. In a set-piece situation such as this, however, the keeper would be fully aware of when the shot is being taken, and in this case, it's a 50-50 chance of the ball flying to his left or his right (taking deflections out of the equation, of course). So, in the video, for example, why doesn't Rulli jump right when he realize the ball is not coming to the left? 

Especially considering when being a goalkeeper requires not only amazing reflexes but quick decision making, I just find it very odd that this happens more often than I would think. Can anyone please help me answer my question?","Why do goalkeepers sometimes ""freeze"" during a free-kick?"

Now I personally think Ronaldo and Messi shouldn't actually be part of this debate, now I hear many reasons why they should however I have counter arguments. Also I know this will get down voted immensely however I just want to say my opinion. If you have a counter argument to this then just say

1. Ronaldo and Messi Won More
Well winning trophies ain't just down to that one player or Dani Alves would be in the conversation

2. Ronaldo and Messi Score More
Well the Ballon d'Or isn't only about Goals so why should this debate?

3. Messi and Ronaldo Are More Skillful
Are they though? Just look at a little bit of footage of Maradona and Pele and you'd see how they can dribble across the whole pitch and score, ye Messi did that once but one was goal of the decade, one is a meme.

4. Pele Didn't Play In a Good League
Just remember at the time not many players moved country I can only think of Jimmy Greeves and Alfredo Di Steffano

5. Messi and Ronaldo Carry Teams
No they don't or Man Utd wouldn't be 7th in the Prem. Also with Messi and Barca last year Messi only carried them to R16 in the UCL and 3rd in La Liga meanwhile Maradona carried Napoli to UEFA Cup and quite alot of success at his time there

6. The Players Were Worse Back Then
Were they though? When people say for example ""Ronaldo&gt;Messi because Messi only scores v Eibar"" that means Eibar must be really bad so they are probably the same level as back then plus I have asked people to compare and they said back then the players were better. Also remember now players get alot more treatment and luxuries but back then there were heavier boots, worser pitches, stronger players

I can go on? Remember also that both Maradona and Pele won the World Cup, Ronaldo Anderson both didn't there are quite alot of World Cup Winners that aren't even in the conversation. Plus Pele was 17 in his first World Cup Win plus he scored in the final and didnt ghost like Messi and ye Brazil then was a hundred times better but if Argentina could get to the final with just Messi they could beat Germany, why do you think it took so long for a Germany goal? There is more too but imma stop the conclude

Conclusion: Ronaldo and Messi are World Class generational players however I think they aren't on that level, here is how i ranked them (in order)

GOAT Main Players: Pele and Maradona and Alfredo di Stefano
Not GOAT Main Players but extremley talented: Cruyff and Puskas and Messi/CR7
Not GOAT quality but also close: Van Basten and Ronaldinho and R9 etc...

498,football,"I think Navas should start. He is probably the most experienced UEFA Champions League goalie currently, with more winners' medals than he can count. Donnarumma is a skill-based better keeper, but has little to zero Champions League experience. IMO, Navas should start matches for the UCL and 25% of Ligue 1. Donnarumma on the other hand should start for 75% of Ligue 1 so he can gain PSG play style experience, and should start 100% of domestic cup ties.

Managers should be allowed to choose when referees go to the VAR monitor. I‚Äôm a part time Knicks fan from Ireland, so excuse me to any Americans if I butcher this, but in the NBA they have Instant Replay.

It is pretty much VAR except it is used more frequently and managers can choose to review plays up to a certain number of times a game. 

Despite me being a City fan, I can see why arsenal fans were upset yesterday with some decisions, so if managers had the option to send referees to the VAR monitor.. surely everyone‚Äôs happy?

524,football,"I would really like to see proper standing terraces back at football clubs. I can‚Äôt help thinking that when supporters are all packed in together, it helps bring everyone together and improve the atmosphere.

I can completely see that disasters like Hillsborough were monumental tragedies, with almost 100 people losing their lives, many more being physically and emotionally scarred, as well as families distraught by the loss and suffering of loved ones.

However, banning standing altogether just seems far over the top to me. Even the ‚Äúsafe standing‚Äù stands that some countries allow seems too much to me. Although people are standing with safe standing, it doesn‚Äôt look like it brings people together in the same way; everyone is still compartmented into their ‚Äúseat‚Äù, and the seats themselves look like a tripping hazard. 

I can‚Äôt see why the number of people allowed into a stadium can‚Äôt just be rigorously policed. How hard can it be to only let a certain number of people through the gates? I accept that there may be break ins when there is a big game, for instance at the last Euros final at Wembley, but there‚Äôs no reason why there can‚Äôt be contingency plans like calling the game off. Health and safety has increased many fold in the last 30 years, and so for one, you could just give a H&amp;S officer absolute authority to call a game off if there is a risk.

The passion in football doesn‚Äôt seem to be like it was, and no doubt this has to do with a number of factors (money, lack of home grown players, general changes in society), but I think the loss of proper terraces is a big part too. More passionate supporters would, to me, seem like a net gain to both football and society generally.",Safe standing - Surely all you need is limits on tickets?

1. **Argentina:** They have a very good rhythm. They are improving constantly. They also have the drive and motivation to win it this time. 
2. **Brazil:** They have been dominating South America for some time. They are just looking very strong
3. **Spain:** They have been the underdogs the past 2 world cups. But Luis Enrique's squad is proving everyone who underestimates them wrong. Many other coaches who have faced Spain have spoken highly about their quality. Many new young sensations will be playing their first world cup: Ansu Fati, Pedri, Gavi, Ferran Torress, Dani Olmo... and many others.  
4. **Italy:** I know there is a good chance that they don't even qualify for the world cup. But they can change. It's a very bright team that can really improve and win it. They've a lot of quality in their squad specially at the back
5. **France:** What an amazing squad!! A very very talented squad. And they truly can win it and succeed in defending their title. But the team doesn't have huge motivation compared to others having won the previous world cup, they can get a little over confident.   


That's my top five pick.   


There are others as well such as:   
*Germany:* They can go a little deep but not too far. A new era of German football has recently started. They might take some time to become favourites  
*England:* Where do I start? This is a very talented squad and on paper it seems like they have a good shot, but it just isn't the year for England. The team's not even at the right place mentally. The racist comments from fans after the Euros were very harsh.",Favourites to Win the World Cup!

Sure, we can easily beat Uruguay, Colombia, even put good fights against Argentina. But I'm not sure we can do the same against the big european dogs. And the fact they avoid friendly matches with Brazil to keep their  tactics a secret doesn't really help.

Not sure we're going to get the so awaited ""hexa"" this year. Country is hungry for it. I think we have a better chance in 2026 and maybe do the same thing we did in 1994 (win a world cup in North America 24 years after the last time we lifted the throphy).",Brazil is not winning this World Cup.

661,football,"I been watching football for a while, and I have to say that  in my opinion the biggest problem with officiating the matches would be the offside rule.

As you know the offside call is very important, because it is usually involve an attacking player beating the defense and being 1v1 with the goalkeeper, or at least being in a very dangerous position with a good goal scoring opportunity.

And yet almost every match there is at least one  wrong offside call made by the referees. And I don't blame them, it is humanely impossible to 100% accurately enforce that law without any technical assistance, because of the small margins involved. Of course in some cases it is impossible to see the exact position of the attacking player compared to defenders down to the millimeter, in the exact moment when a pass is being made.

Now they made the ball crossing the goal line decision automatic, meaning the computer decides weather or not the ball have crossed the goal line, and they took that decision from the referee's responsibility. But the thing is that questionable goal line crossing moments are very rare, like few times a year, while wrong offside calls being made every match as I already said. So automatic system for offside calls should be much more important than goal line system.

So I think the same should be done with offside calls as with goal line ball crossing. That decision should be completely removed from the field referees responsibility, and instead there should be a specially offside designated referee sitting somewhere in a room full of screens and whatever digital technology he needs,  and all the offside calls should be entirely up to him. Problem solved.",Offside ruling should be automatic

726,football,"Firstly, this is not an attempt at a joke, I'm just looking for some serious analysts/enthusiasts who can provide me (or perhaps the entire football community) with intel.
I'm genuinely wondering. As a Utd fan, I have to watch him almost every week and I am still curious how they paid 80 mil quid for him. 
To cross-check, I actually watched some games from the lower leagues (Championship, English League One) to see how the defending compares and to be quite frank, I could not point a finger to a single feature of Harry Maguire that sets him apart from the defenders in the lower tiers. Heavy on his feet, low sense of anticipation, average tackling, sparse long passing. Some players, like Dominic Iorfa from Sheffield Wednesday, actually exhibit a great level of orientation, pace and prompt decision-making.
I should also add that I'm aware of Utd's lack of midfield coverage which often puts the defence at risk, but you can see Maguire's sloppy defending skills even when the opponent's attack is gradual rather than fast-paced.

I have heard that much of Spain's success, besides having a lot of generational talent, was due to Aragon√©s and Spain seemed to play their best football at Euro 2008. They apparently played worse under del Bosque's tenure.

Would Aragon√©s have won the 2010 World Cup and 2012 Euros, had he remained manager? Would Spain have been as successful had del Bosque been manager in 2004 instead of Aragon√©s?",Luis Aragon√©s vs Vicente del Bosque: Who was a better manager for Spain?

Especially aubamenyang. Take him, for example: since he signed his contract for a hefty salary, he's been doing substandard. Even though he's actually capable of being a top 5 PL striker. Same thing w coutinho and dembele ‚Äì great quality, but underperformed after joining barca. Millions of dollars spent is supposed to make your team better, not keep it at the same level or get worse. 

My point is that sometimes, or oftentimes, players sign contracts worth a fixed amount, say, 100 million. But, like, theres something about it that irks me. If you got the money, what's the need to put in the effort? 

Of course, not *all* players are like that. Messi, cr7, lewandowski, haaland, mbappe, pedri, ansu, benzema, and other guys *deserve* the money they get cuz they're consistent. They score goals and perform well. It's reasonable to offer em like huge fixed contracts. 

But for players whose performances are variable,  their contracts should also be variable ‚Äì in other words, if you do good, you get more money; if you underperform, you get less money. Salary = proportional to efforts and performance. 

I mean, hopefully you get my point but idk how else to say it lmao",Tbh there should be more variable contracts

1034,football,,Today is my luckiest day. I bought this super box and got a T-shirt signed by my idol. I am very happy! ! ! !
1035,football,"I was going to post this to r/afraidtoask, but I figure that here I could find more football players here.
So, here's my theory. In East Europe, specifically in Romania (my country), Ukraine, Russia, there's no much air play. There are far more crosses in the Premier League, Primera Division, Serie A etc., more goals scored with a header, and not only this - for example, the attack is more unpredictible, because the defensive players don't know what to expect, sometimes (you can destabilize the defense with a cross).
But why is that?
In Romania junior football teams are training in smaller fields. I am not absolutely sure of that, someone should do some statistical research on this. My personal experience is all I have. And from my experience, I can tell that most children play football in the school yard or on a smaller synthetic field. What this implies is that they undervalue the aerial game, tend to lack a dynamic understanding of the game, and lack technical skills like passing, crossing and ball control when running (because when you play on a smaller field you don't need to run as much as on a bigger one).
My question is for football players, especially, and people with direct experience with the training practice: did you train, as young player, on a football field with standard dimensions (90-110 m long, 45-90 m wide), or more like one for handball or basketball? Please specify your country.

I am in grade 11, and we have to write an ""Extended Essay"", which we choose the subject we are going to talk about, and we have to discuss it deeply, research read books and articles, etc. Obviously, I thought about football, but I have no idea how to make the research question look educational.

I want (if possible) the research question to be about managers like Pep Guardiola as I think his/their tactics and way of thinking (i guess) is fascinating, like how effective are German managers in the premier league, but a bit more educational.

&amp;#x200B;

The research question is  A research question is 'a question that a research project sets out to answer'. Choosing a research question is an essential element of both quantitative and qualitative research. Investigation will require data collection and analysis, and the methodology for this will vary widely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Extended Essay is  What is extended essay?The extended essay (often called the EE) is **a 4000-word structured essay on a topic of your choice which can take many different forms**. ... Some students choose to write their extended essay in literature or history, which means they write a more traditional academic essay. 

&amp;#x200B;

No pressure as in the end this is my work, if you think this is by any chance ""cheating"" you may just write an example that will help me understand how to write my research question.

Every club has it's up and down so the time is yours however there are several ways to compete for elite status again. As a Madrid fan , THERE IS NO ONE happier than me to see the downfall of your club . However, I like to enjoy good football which Barcelona produced in prime Messi-Iniesta-Xavi era. I would also like to see Barca bounce back otherwise would become Farmer's league.  First and foremost, sell the deadwood. Pique, Umititi, Besquets, Demebele, Ter Stegen etc. They have been past their prime or not interested to commit to the club. Sell them at a loss if that what it takes. The solution is La Masia!!!. Your academy was once the elite academy for producing talents for the football world. Invest in promoting Spanish talent through the ranks and into the first team. Your squad should be made from 80% of La Masia graduates. Barcelona sold Neymar for 220 million dollars and made the market inflated so no good player comes cheap. Second of all, stop looking for the next Neymar and Messi in every player. This is what cost you in the first place. You were never able to replace Neymar with all the money you had. You will never be able to replace Messi for another billion dollars so look at the road ahead without these players. Third, Xavi is not Guardiola. Don't make him a scapegoat for your failures. Guardiola inherited prime xavi, iniesta, ronaldinho and young Messi. Xavi doesn't inherit anyone except Pedri, Puig, Gavi. Last but not least, dropping out of UCL is not the greatest humiliation. It is the UEL where the real test awaits you. It is there where you can find out if your club is still finished or not. Oh and one last thing, don't expect Barcelona to bounce back in another 2 years or so. AC Milan got into UCL after 7 YEARS!!!. Good things take time to come to fruition.

Hala Madrid! we will bring the UCL home.

1311,football,[removed],Are chelsea actually a top 5 team within Europe??
1312,football,"1. I genuinely dislike Pique and think he should have been kicked from Barcelona years ago. In tight matches he will always make poor decisions and somehiw cost the game.
I have watched the 4-0 loss to Liverpool game, and at least 2 goals are on him. 1st goal he allowed too easily for Henderson to go through him, 3rd goal that was scored from a cross he simply failed to cover his area.
It's ok for a defender occasionally to get beaten by an opponent player, but the easiness with which it happens to Pique is unacceptable.
The guy sucks.
2. The main reason for Barca decline is that some players got bigger than a club. Do you expect for anonymous and replacable coaches like Velverde or Setien to be an authority figure for Barca players? It's hard for me to believe. So the players got careless and lazy, and simply refused to put in the work. They been sleep walking on the pitch since that game in Roma. And they had the tendency to go sleeping even before that, for example in 2017 against PSG 4-0 and Juve 3-0.",I dislike Pique. And the main reason for Barca decline.

* No subs after the 80th minute (110th in extra time), forcing managers specializing in this to make changes earlier than planned. Players who deliberately exit the pitch slowly as the 80th minute nears will see their teammate replacing them receive a yellow card in a form of collective punishment.

* All suspected dives are reviewed by VAR and merit a red card if found guilty of simulation with up to 5 official matches and a fine for deception. Free kick shall be given to the opposing team.

* Leagues and competitions with no VAR available for all of their matches must waive the penalty kick, thus discouraging gamemanship and other underhanded tactics. A direct free kick will be taken instead.

* The Linesmen and the Fourth Official have the ability to yellow-card and even send off players who commit fouls and/or dive outside the referee's field of sight.

Gr√™mio - a team of which, largely, due to mismanagement and abysmal dismay, downplaying the facts' seriousness - is being purged for too long being flirting and falling victim to the seduction of playing with an immeasurable risk of losing all the prestige and credibility of a giant it has been and has to succeed in showing a great deal of effort to counter this danger at the last moments while it edges the abyss.

It has been memorably, throughout the entire tournament, marked in the red list of the competition's worst-positioned teams. The intriguing fact is that the rumored fame for the Brazilian football be highly centered in an equilibrium where nothing is predictable strikes again and it is penalizing now a team with, theoretically, good names in it, which thanks to negligence is agonizing, gasping for air.

The fact of the matter is that just an unlikely number sequencing and the less imaginable probability to save them now, the reason for why today's round, the latest match of the season, is the most exciting one as they're struggling with unreal chances from being sentenced to purgatory.

The early triumph of Atletico MG, after a 5 decades-long insistence to claim a significant title again was, indeed, amazing, however, it's the first time I visualize the apprehension mounting in the extreme opposite side of the classification table, as both believers of a miracle and joking rivals scornfully agglomerate over the same object altogether.

* Another instance is Griezmann, who got transfered to Barca for [120 millon euros](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0i_nmt9X0AhVnm-AKHVLOD1kQFnoECAIQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2844005-antoine-griezmann-completes-barcelona-transfer-from-atletico-madrid&amp;usg=AOvVaw1m55G73sfkmnDqg0ps_H4r)

Now, I'm not saying that they're necessarily bad players (in fact, right now Barca has a pretty good quality team), but Neymar's trade was momentous. In fact, since that event, Barca hasn't won a CL title.

Not just that, but what's astounding is, over a decade ago, Ronaldo came to Madrid, Juventus, and ManU for [much less](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimgpnmr9X0AhXHSjABHWThC4UQFnoECAsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F197011-80-million-record-fee-agreed-ronaldo-is-going-to-real-madrid&amp;usg=AOvVaw0anE6FjzE9JmtvsK_eKK5Q) than the above guys. And he's won at least a few trophies with Real, a PL, some Serie A's, and all.

Elite Level European football has reached a new era. The individual superstar has never been less important.

Tuchel, Klopp, Guardiola have turned the Premier League into the most tactically advanced in world football.

It‚Äôs always fun to debate what team is the best in Premier League history?
Whether that‚Äôs in the pub with friends, on Twitter (less fun) or a subreddit online, we will have our own opinion on which side was the best, so whoever you choose; United‚Äôs treble winners of 1999, the invincible of side 2004, Mourinho‚Äôs Chelsea, United‚Äôs 2008 team or one of Peps City sides or Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool team, it is ultimately a subjective decision, underlying biases, personal preference and statistical data and you can make case for any one of those sides, whoever your choice is, some people will agree others will disagree. Alas, such is life.

What has become almost indisputable though, throughout the Premier League era, is that since Manchester United and Arsenal‚Äôs dominance of the nineties and early noughties, the Premier League has changed dramatically, tactically.

When Manchester United won the Premier League title in 1996, Eric Cantona played as the second striker behind Andrew Cole in a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation for Alex Ferguson‚Äôs side, he was the connector and finisher for United, the attacks went through him, he scored fourteen goals for United that season in the league, Including netting six games in a row in a vital stretch between March and April as United beat Newcastle, Arsenal and Tottenham 1‚Äì0, thanks to Cantona‚Äôs goals.

In 2021 Cantona would be excepted to press from the font and work tirelessly defensively for the team. In 1996 nobody cared to ask such questions, Ferguson allowed him the freedom to stay up top and be United‚Äôs game-changer, just over a decade later Ferguson give Cristiano Ronaldo that same freedom as United won a treble of leagues titles and a Champions League. Ronaldo was instrumental for United, winning the 2008 Ballon d‚ÄôOr.
This season Cristiano returned to United, citing unfinished business, while his return has brought goals, his role within United‚Äôs system has been a constant topic of controversy.
Olle Gunnar Solskjaer biggest struggle at Manchester United, before being dismissed, was implementing a system around Ronaldo and his lack of pressing, an identity on and off the ball.

The Ronaldo conundrum has become an endless barrage of think-pieces, radio rants, podcast debates and television soap operas, we got the answer to what happens when you put an Irish man and scouser in a room together and watch them argue ‚Äì Roy Keane v Jamie Carragher encapsulated just out how silly the whole debate has become. (It was great TV!)

So how can a four-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner, Champions League all-time top scorer and five-time champions league winner, be the problem? It‚Äôs not like Ronaldo‚Äôs form has fallen off a cliff, his goal-scoring remains elite, he has saved United countless times already this season with clutch goals. As for his inability to press, ‚Äì Ronaldo has never pressed, not ten years ago, not today.

Put simply ‚Äì the Premier League has evolved, drastically from the nineties, noughties and even then in the last decade.

The league began with traditional British tactics ‚Äì flat lines, 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formations, with an emphasis on physicality, set-pieces, second balls, traditional wide players and old fashioned number nines.

In the mid-two-thousands, Mourinho‚Äôs Chelsea side and Rafa Benitez Liverpool side introduced the use of the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation, double pivots, low blocks, playing between the lines, with an emphasis on shape and discipline.

Pep Guardiola iconic Barcelona side (2008‚Äì2012) changed European football forever, clubs all over the world become obsessed with ‚ÄòJuego de Posicion ‚Äì possession-based football built around false nines, technical midfielders, ball-playing centre-backs, sweeper-keepers and playing out from the back.

The Premier League elite took notice, moving away from the more defensive, pragmatic systems that had defined the first half of the two-thousands.

It was not until 2015 when Liverpool hired Jurgen Klopp that the Premier League got its first taste of ‚Äògegenpressing‚Äô (counter-pressing to try and win the ball back immediately after you lose it, to try to always attack and outnumber the opposing ball owner with at least one man.)

A year later Pep Guardiola was hired by Manchester City and the current era of pressing and possession had arrived on our English soil. The rest is history; Man City have won three of the last four titles, breaking several records, including ‚Äì hundred point season and an English treble of trophies.
Liverpool then won the Champions League and Premier League titles (they‚Äôre the first title in 30 years) in back to back seasons.
Liverpool at their best is a team in cohesion, pressing as one, in a swarm-like movement, where the whole team moves towards the ball, suffocating the opposition, and turning defence into offence.

When Liverpool signed Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, they were not seen as world-class superstars, but highly talented wide-players with untapped potential, Klopp turned the African duo into work horses and pressing machines through coaching on the training ground.

Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez are elite level operators, who would find a place in any squad in world football, yet for Manchester City and Pep they leave their ego to the side, they accept their roles, as cogs in the engine and know exactly how and when to press, counter-press and what patterns of passing and movements to make.

Thomas Tuchel won the Champions League with Chelsea without a renowned superstar attacker in his squad.
Chelsea found a tactical identity under Tuchel using compact defending and quick transitions, smart, active, ball-orientated pressing, ‚Äì again turning defending into a form of attack.

Managers need to coach, coaches need to manage, the two go hand in hand, it‚Äôs a symphony, in previous years, managers could afford one or two luxury players, who because of their brilliance in the final third, were given the freedom to coast on defence.
Paris Saint Germain are perhaps the most pertinent example of all when it comes to being unable to get the best out of their superstar individual players.

PSG has been managed by two of Europe‚Äôs most modern, tactical forward-thinking coaches. Thomas Tuchel and now Mauricio Pochetino, both managers renowned for coaching high-press, physically fit, technically savvy sides. Yet at Paris with the superstar attackers, both managers have struggled to fit them into their playing style. If Neymar, Mbappe and now Messi refuse to trackback and press from the front, Paris is instantly at a numerical disadvantage. The most recent Champions League defeat to Manchester City was the perfect example of what happens when you play individual v collective in today‚Äôs game.

The most important man on a football pitch in top-level European football stands not between the lines, but on the touchline, this has become more and more evident over the past half-decade, as we‚Äôve watched the Premier League become the dominant force in Europe. Look no further than the Champions League, in the last three years, there have been two all-English affairs in the finals Chelsea v Manchester City in 2020‚Äì21, Liverpool v Tottenham in 2018‚Äì19. You have to go back to the 2007‚Äì08 season for an all-English final before 2018‚Äì19.

Pep, Klopp and Tuchel are not identical in the way they set their teams up to succeed, all three managers have different philosophical ideas on how they perceive the beautiful game, yet there are certain fundamentals, each coach adheres to:

Playing a high defensive line, exploiting the opposition through the use of their full-backs, counter-attacking with speed, brilliant in possession, pressing intelligently in and out of possession and player or ball-orientated zonal marking.

All of these principles have one thing in common, it‚Äôs the collective over the individual.
You need world-class players to have any chance of winning the league, you need a world-class manager, to make that a reality.
Cristiano Ronaldo is not the problem, but his manager must put him in a position to succeed, where his extreme positives, lead to wins on the pitch.

Superclubs have to look beyond signing superstars first and fitting a coach in second.

To mirror the likes of City, Liverpool and Chelsea, in 2021‚Äì22 a manager who can coach a clearly defined system is more valuable than any 200 million pound player.","Pep, Klopp, Tuchel have ushered in a new era of top-level tactical football"
1534,football,"A decent amount of people are questioning the adequacy of the 2021 Ballon d'Or. They say that Robert Lewandowski should have been awarded, not Lionel Messi.

However, I think that Lewandowski had no reason to be awarded as Messi's performance was much more deserving.

The only portion where Lewandowski outperforms Messi is that he has scored more goals than Messi. But the problem is that, that's it. Messi outperforms Lewandowski in every category excluding the number of goals. 

I know that Lewandowski scored 41 goals in Bundesliga and broke Muller's record, which is outstanding, but he never managed to advance to the high place in both UCL and Euro.

Bayern was knocked out at the quarter finals by PSG, while Poland didn't even reached to the round of 16. Moreover, Bayern was also knocked out at the round of 32 in DFB-Pokal by Holstein Kiel which was playing at the second division of the German football league.

Let's travel back time to the season 2015-2016, when Luis Suarez scored 40 goals in 'La Liga' and made 16 assists, being the top goal scorer and assister for the first time in La Liga history. He scored 59 goals and made 22 assists when we consider the whole season.

However, his Ballon d'Or ranking was 4th, beneath Messi, Ronaldo, and Griezmann. 

Even if we exclude LM10 and CR7, Griezmann is yet above at the chart, compared to Suarez.

The main reason is because Griezmann's performance for his national team was terrific. 

Now let's look at Messi's performance. He is the top scorer of La Liga and most importantly, he won the Copa America dominating the MVP, top goalscorer, top assister at the same time. No other players have managed to win a major competition held by FIFA, dominating all three individual achievements at the same time. Not even Pele, or Maradona have succeeded it.

Some might say that Copa America is easy to win due to its irregular host period and the number of participating nations. However, the history of Copa America is even older than the World Cup. Also, it consists of nations with decent performances. For example, Equador won against CR7's portugal. 

The player with the most goals is not always ranked at the 1st place in Ballon d'Or. If it were, Messi would take 9 Ballon d'Ors, while Ronaldo only takes 1.

Now tell me, why should Lewandowski win the 2021 Ballon d'Or? If it was 2020, I would definitely agree that he should take it, but seriously, 2021?",The adequacy of the 2021 Ballon d'Or

Fast forward a few months, we're in early December and Lukaku has **only scored 3 Premier League goals, in 691 minutes of game time.** (230 minutes per goal / 2.5 matches per goal).

He has come off the bench in 3 straight matches. 

Thankfully for Chelsea, they have a deep squad and can withstand a rough patch from their star man. But if this continues into 2022, there will be some serious questions asked.

For now, the verdict is still out and Romelu will have ample chances to re-gain his form. But the UK media can be ruthless. He's gotta get his act together.

I wonder if he regrets joining Chelsea. Similar to how he eventually regretted joining Man United.

1681,football,"I'm going to address two misconceptions about the Ballon D'or, one is its nomination process and the second is criteria of voting.

**Misconception 1: Nomination process**

The nomination process:

1. France Football (FF) gives 150+ journalists from all around the world a vote. Each country has 1 journalist.
2. The journalist then gets a list (30 nominated players) and has to rank them, with the number 1 getting more points then the number 2 (for instance, if you vote Messi as number 1 he gets 5 points and if you vote Lewandowski as number 2 he gets 4 points, etc).
3. Then, all the points are accumulated and the player with most points is the winner of the Ballon D'or, player with second most points second place etc.
4. So a journalist doesn't only choose who they think should win BdO, but also who should be number 2 etc. This is important because it splits the vote, also known as ranked-choice voting.
5. Then, all the points are added up and the player with the most points wins the BdO, player with second most points second place, etc.

Thus, the organization that holds the Ballon D'or, France Football (FF), does not choose the winner. Journalists all around the world do based on ranked voting. This means that France Football does not ''rob'' players, it's just that the journalists choose different than what you expected.

**Misconception 2: Selection criteria**

The journalists who vote do not have an obligatory way of selecting who they see as number 1, number 2 etc. It's true that there are some criteria circling around, but they are not enforced. This means that the journalist can choose to form their own opinion based on what they find important.

Now, most journalists around the world do not have the time to go watch every La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, etc other national titles games of Europe. Especially if you are a journalist outside of Europe,  you also have to concentrate on the football inside your own country (for instance the Brazilian journalist will probably also spend time on the Brazilian league and Copa Libertadores).

What are the competitions most journalists will be more likely to watch?

1. World Cup
2. Euro's / Copa America / AFCON / AFC Asian Cup
3. Champions League etc

In other words, it's much more likely that journalists will capture your performance on the international stage and then form their opinion based on that. So, international performance is much more important for winning BdO than is national league performance.

[This is why Messi had the most G+A in 2018](https://i.redd.it/f0hp8vhuz4381.jpg) and won La Liga 17/18 and 18/19 with 17 points above Ballon D'or winner Modric but still only ended up 5th place in the BdO ranking.  Modric that year had won the Champions League and had an amazing World Cup performance. Journalists ranked that higher than Messi having most G+A and winning La Liga double.",Addressing two misconceptions about the Ballon D'or
1682,football,"On a subreddit I'm a member of, a guy compared the current PSG squad to the Real Madrid squad of the first Galacticos era. In my humble opinion, there is no comparison whatsoever.

1741,football,"And before you guys shit on me for posting the same thing that is being posted for last couple of days, I wanna say I‚Äôm a Messi fan and I had 51-49 to Lewandowski for B‚Äôdor *(by this I mean I edged towards Lewa)*. But enough of this awards here is my real question. 

So, Messi plays in so many positions. What would you say his actual position is. Regardless of where he is shown in squad lists. He plays as mid most of the times and he has always been a play maker ever since Pep arrived at Barca. I see him sometimes as AMF, RW, F9, no. 9. So what would you say is his actual position? Is it a free moving position if there is such a thing? 

And why would you say he can tap into so many aspects of the game? Obviously he might not be the best at those positions *(no. 9 obviously Ronaldo, AMF or play making abilities maybe KDB or Iniesta are better than him)* but just a mere fact that he can actually play in these positions and still be a close second is insane. 

Someone said *‚Äúhe is the only midfielder with 750 goals and only forwards with 300+ assists‚Äù* which is kinda true right?

And my last question would be how would someone like Ronaldo and Lewandowski do if they tried to play these many aspects of the game at the same time? Not hating on these great players, obviously every one has their own role but just a question out of curiosity.","Hey guys, I have a question regarding play styles of Messi and other great players."

A lot of people out there seem to treat people who call it soccer as second-rate enjoyers of the sport and that‚Äôs simply not fair: it‚Äôs *supposed* to be called soccer; that‚Äôs its real name. If you look at the history of ‚Äòfootball‚Äô it‚Äôs clear that it started out as being called football, but that‚Äôs only the case for a couple of reasons. First, the term ‚Äòfootball‚Äô merely refers to *any* sport not played on horseback but rather on *foot*. That‚Äôs where the name comes from. Football is not called football because you play it with your feet. It‚Äôs called football because you play it *on* your feet. Because of this American football has just as much of a right to be called football as British football does. Second, the original football was actually just a combination of rugby and soccer. It‚Äôs only in 1863 that soccer and rugby were split into different sports from what was called ‚Äòfootball‚Äô. Therefore, to distinguish between the sport of soccer and rugby, soccer was called ‚Äúassociation football‚Äù, which is where the name soccer comes from: it‚Äôs an abbreviation of the word association. The Americans only call the sport soccer because the British brought that name to the Americas: it‚Äôs not some *American* bastardization of football, but actually an abbreviation of British origin that was brought to the Americans by the British themselves. Calling British football ‚Äòfootball‚Äô didn‚Äôt develop until later because rugby was still called football until it began being called rugby; it was only then that the term soccer was abandoned (although, obviously, it continued to exist in other countries).  *Because* the term 'football' just means any sport played on your feet, it's more appropriate to actually call it soccer instead, because that's what it actually is.",'Football' Should be Called Soccer (please don't kill me)

If you swap Messi and Lewandowski‚Äôs places, where Messi plays for Bayern and Poland, while Lewandowski plays for Barca and Argentina, truth is, Lewa can‚Äôt do what Messi does for Barca, putting this atrociously poor Barca side all the way up to the 3rd in Laliga. The Argentine team was a much better side, but I think we can all agree that there‚Äôs no way Lewa can elevate the team like Messi does. Meanwhile in the Bundesliga with a much dominant Bayern Munich, truth is, with or without Lewa, Bayern would probably still have won Bundesliga and the other trophies as well. And I think we can all agree that Messi would dominate the Bundesliga just as much, if not more. The Poland National team obviously was one of the worse sides in the Euros, but I think achieving just 1 point in the group stage is something we should still look as a downside of Lewa‚Äôs incredible season. This is the Ballon D‚Äôor. You can‚Äôt be ‚Äúexcused‚Äù from the international football argument just because you have a poor side. You have to bring out something surprising, memorable, or commendable to have people look at your international football and make a strong case for why you deserve Ballon D‚Äôor as well. And that is what Modric has done, which is why he won it. I think the significance of both players says a lot. Lewa is the best player on the best team. Messi is THE team.

But I won‚Äôt take Lewa‚Äôs insane scoring record for granted. He had an incredible year. And honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be too mad about it if he won the Ballon D‚Äôor. Both players were very deserving of this award.",Why Messi deserved the Ballon D‚Äôor (My opinion)

So from time to time I like to write a post how average and overhyped Lewa in my opinion is, and get a lot of downvotes for that of course (but I don't care).

Yeah, those 3 are decent strikers, that if a chance created for them in the box, they could perhaps convert it into a goal.... a header, a tap in, perhaps an occasional kick outside the box, the generic stuff that are expected from an average striker.

But for few last seasons this Lewa guy is being presented to us as some hot thing. First, he was playing  for Bayern since 2014, what did he do during 2014-18? Nothing much right? Because Bayern was pretty average, so he was also unnoticeable. But since  Bayern started to improve and play good, Lewa became this ""super striker"" all of a sudden, when in fact he is just a simple tap-in machine.

His 15 goals in last season CL were totally worthless. 11 of his goals were in group stage, with teams like Olympiakos and Red Star, and Tottenham. Also his 4 goals in the knock out stage were pretty useless also. 3 against Chelsea (out of 7) and 1 against Barcelona (out of 8). Also those goals came when these games were already pretty much decided, he scored against Chelsea when Bayern was already leading 2-0, against Barca when the lead was 5-2. 

So statistically speaking if you delete all his 15 goals, Bayern will still end up winning the CL.

The BD shows just what it means to show, the opinion of selected journalists around the world who is the best player in the world. 

(btw you will see on almost any football website or magazine regular mentioning of Messi or Ronaldo, because that what sells. therefore journalists are more inclined to mention and cover them, because that what gets the clicks, and not necessarily due to their performance on the pitch)

Messi is by far the greatest to ever touch a ball (except for Harry Maguire ofc) and he deserved to win that ball more than anything this year. His Copa America campaign was insane. He carried that team for 90% of the matches. Some of the goals he has scored recently... he only gets better. Idc what anyone says about anyone. NO ONE plays like Messi plays.

1871,football,"Lewandowski deserved it in 2020 and its sad and painful as shit to see him not get the Ballon D'or he deserved.   
Lewandowski had an amazing year. But unfortunately for lewa fans, Messi outperformed him this year.   


Here's why:  
**Winning Copa America**  
No matter who you are, you've got to appreciate what Messi has done for his country this year. And you've got to feel happy for the man. This guy just deserved it. Here are the pointers:  


* Ended a 28 year trophy drought for his country
* Player of the Tournament
* Top Goal scorer
* Top Assist provider
* Absolutely killed it. Seriously the guy was so good. One of the best performances at international level if not the best.   


**Winning Cop del Rey**  
This is something a lot of people are neglecting. Copa del Rey is pretty competitive. It's not a very easy trophy. But Messi won it!   
But here's the part what in my opinion is **the biggest reason** why he deserves it.   
Barca are a mess right now without Messi. Lat year, they one the Copa del Rey, and this year Barca isnt even able to qualify for the the Knockout stage of the champions league!!!   
This just shows how much Messi carried Barca last year and took them to great heights.   
&gt;!Yes I know there was also Griezmann who left the club, but lets be honest. If you watched the games you know much he was involved. !&lt;  


**Stat Sheet**  
A lot of people are using the stats to prove that Lewa deserved it. But they are just calculating the G/A.   
If that were the deciding factor, our man, Leo would have won like 9 golden balls!   
Please compare the Stat sheet. Messi leads in every category except Goals scored. &gt;!Ignore Benzema here guys. Sorry. !&lt;The Stat sheet speaks for itself.

Spain has put very good performances under Luis Enrique.  
Despite Spain's performance, we all can agree that this isn't their full potential. Players like Ansu Fati, Sergio Ramos, Gavi who might be available for the World Cup would really improve their game.

1951,football,"

1. Robert Lewandowski: Carried on from last year where he was robbed of the award. He deserves to be awarded two ballon d‚ÄôOrs tomorrow. 

2. Lionel Messi: Produced great numbers as usual and has finally won a major award with Argentina where he played a big part. The only other deserved winner. 

3. Mo Salah: If he carries on this form he could be a solid contender for next years award. Produced some moments of individual brilliance and seems to be back to his best. 

4. Erling Haaland: Once again had produced great numbers and has well and truly cemented his name as one of the world elite this year. 

5. Kylian Mbappe: Another top year for Mbappe, not as good as the previous couple of years but still good enough to be this far up this list.

6. Karim Benzema: Taken on more responsibility since Ronaldo‚Äôs departure and this year his has gone to the next level and is producing more goals and performances than he ever has. 

7. Jorginho: A top top player who I really like.  He‚Äôs played a big part in both Chelsea and Italy‚Äôs wins and you can‚Äôt deny the great year he‚Äôs had even though he‚Äôs not the best midfielder for Italy or Chelsea. 

8. N‚ÄôGolo Kant√©: We all know how good Kante has been over the last 6 years and now he‚Äôs finally added a Champions League medal to that list. No coincidence he‚Äôs in that team. 

9. Kevin De Bruyne: Another premier league title and a top year for De Bruyne. The most important player for the current best team in the world in my opinion. 

10. Cristiano Ronaldo: At 36, he‚Äôs slowing down but still producing big numbers and moments of brilliance. Become the international top goal scorer of all time and dragged United through the Champions League group stages. Don‚Äôt write him off, it‚Äôs Ronaldo.

11. Neymar: His numbers have slowed down but his performances haven‚Äôt. Works harder than a lot of people think and is just too insanely good with a football at his feet to be ignored in this list. 

Now here are players who I think had a great year in which some haven‚Äôt even been nominated.

Marco Veratti: The best midfielder in the world in my opinion. It‚Äôs a shame about the injuries otherwise he‚Äôd be on the shortlist. Never seen someone so good on the ball under pressure.  

Joshua Kimmich: Had another solid year and is a close second in a dominant Bayern Munich team. Failure in the Champions League and Euros denies his a place on the list. 

Riyad Mahrez: Seems to be getting better and better under Guardiola and has established himself as one of the best wingers on the planet. 

Ruben Dias: Probably the only defender who stands out this year.  The missing piece of the puzzle for Man City in getting back on track to becoming the best team in the premier league once again. 

Leonardo Bonucci &amp; Giorgio Chiellini: Two typical solid Italian centre backs who have finally got themselves a major trophy for their county.  Both have had great careers and you have to say it‚Äôs well deserved. 

Declan Rice: More MOTM awards than anyone and put West Ham in the Europa League for the first time while being the best player in the Euros final. John Terry described him as the best player in the world in his position, Hoddle described him as the best player in the Premier League and Guardiola said he‚Äôs an ‚Äòexceptional player.‚Äô 

Mason Mount: Had a wonderful year for Chelsea by winning their player of the season and set up the champions league winning goal. Also cemented himself as an England starter and reached the Euros final. 

Phil Foden: The most natural ability of any young player in the world at the moment.  Makes football look incredibly easy at times and is good enough to be competing with the worlds best.

2019,SoccerBetting,"Okay, I know they're 8th right now but hear me out, I think there's some value to Wolves in this market.

I had a bet on them to beat Man United last Monday, and when it landed I thought I'd put some of the profits on a top 4 finish as a bit of a season long interest bet. I expected to get 50/1, maybe 66/1 but my regular bookmaker had them at 100/1.

I shopped around a bit more and spotted the price is almost double that with some bookmakers, I've got 175/1 on as well as my initial 100/1.

Obviously this is a bit of a punt, but I don't think the price should be anywhere near 175/1 in a COVID hit season, where many matches are likely to be postponed and fixtures could pile up for any side.

They've got one of the best defences in the league, conceding only 14 goals so far and although scoring has been an issue, there's been enough of an upturn in form recently to make me think that the goalscoring might get better soon. 

There's probably only one place to play for with Man City running away with the league, and Chelsea and Liverpool seemingly battling out second place, but neither Arsenal, Spurs, Man United or West Ham have looked entirely convincing this season, and with their prices being between 21/10 and 6/1 in this market I can't help but feel Wolves are potentially massively overpriced.",Outside bet for a top 4 finish

2021,SoccerBetting,"Slight rant:

Been betting for like 5 years now, have read a lot on gambling, experimented a lot, tried the whole modelling thing, written thousands of lines of code chasing that dream and it was all for nothing. I have friends who don't even think beyond the basics of football betting but when you tally how much they've won in that period they're in the green way more than I am. They play the usual on-a-hunch large accumulators and once or thrice a year they strike big. It's a fucking joke haha. I'm just disillusioned and don't feel like putting any effort. I read a quote once that in football betting on a long enough timeline and string of bets the guy who does strategic betting and the random gambler are almost indistinguishable. ""Football is a stochastic"" I read on this sub once, pretty cynical outlook but I feel like I'm starting to agree with it more as the days go by

Anyway, as a fun exercise, I've always wondered the chances of someone striking big if they played a large accumulator bet of teams picked out with the same strategy. What are the odds the stars will align one day. It's definitely not lottery levels. Like if you play $1 each day for one year on a 20 game accumulator with teams picked on shallow stats like recent three games or recent goal average what are the odds of it ever hitting. How would you calculate a probability of something like this?","Mug betting strategy, how do you calculate the chances of this?"

2036,SoccerBetting,"I love the community and have been lurking and posting almost every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my (kind of moonshot) theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day or every other day find ( as a community) and  bet on one match. odds\~2.00 to double up your money. 

if we are consistent with this and we can double up our money we can make some serious bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example.

&amp;#x200B;

Day1. start with lets say 10 units ( it can be 1u or 1000 u depending on your Br). 

10x2=20

&amp;#x200B;

Day2. 20x2=40

Day3. 40x2=80  Note. here you can bank a portion of it for some profit. lets say 30u.

Day 4. 50x2=100

Day 5. 100x2=200

Day6. 200x2= 400 Bank 100 

Day 7. 300x2 =600 

After this you need balls of steel to carry on but you also have to trust the process.+

etc etc etc. Keep in mind you ONLY lost 10 and if you lose youre back to square one. 

but if you luck out and go lets say 15 in a row its stupid money no?

&amp;#x200B;

Now I do  understand that its a long shot, and many of you will say things in the vein of no one is that lucky and it will never work but we have one advantage. A community that enjoys betting on soccer and in some cases is Okay to good at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i propose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday we vote until like the afternoon on One single bet of odds about 2.

We win we carry on with the strategy. We lose, no sweat we lose and start over. In the interim we cash out some of our winnings and we keep a streak going like a record. We can even be competitive about it. Like reddits soccer betting streak is at 9 Lets beat that.  Imagine we 100x or 1000x our money? I believe we can do that as a community.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening and hope this gets picked up. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: we can double our money every day as a community.",Finding one 2x every day or every other day.

How do you guys manage this situation regarding your betting strategy?

2069,SoccerBetting,[removed],"New to Reddit. 9 years experience, worked with investors and had a private group for around 4 years."
2070,SoccerBetting," Email to journalists sociologists psychologists behavioural economists and mathematicians 

Because nobody on forums listens to me the following email will from June this year start being sent to up to 
10,000 maths departments 
10,000 sociology departments 
5000 behavioural economics departments and
5000 psychology departments of schools colleges and universities all over the world 

As well as to any newspaper and journalist writing about money sport or gambling for any newspaper or magazine in the western world I or anyone assisting me notices.

Over the next four years starting slowly and building up.


I‚Äôm writing to tell you about a unique situation. Something you will no doubt find hard to believe.

My motive for writing is that I‚Äôm seriously worried about having a stroke or even dying before passing this on to others.

Because it‚Äôs very hard to believe I‚Äôve included what I trust you will find to be ample evidence.

Ever since 2004 I‚Äôve made a living in a way I‚Äôm not at all proud of. 
I‚Äôve been a professional gambler. 

And I have no doubt whatsoever that the main reason I am able to profit from sports betting is because my method is by far the easiest way to win money from sports betting not including matched betting and things of that nature. 

And for many years now I have tried to let gamblers know that this method gives you a much better chance of winning long term than the one widely advised by all the experts etc. Especially since it‚Äôs a much less addictive method.

Yet to my great astonishment, bemusement and exasperation it would appear that it‚Äôs impossible to give it away. At least it is to gamblers.

Not only that but merely trying to elicits nothing but abuse or criticism.

And so I‚Äôm now giving it away to educated non gamblers. What they do with it is entirely up to them of course. I merely see it as my duty  to ensure the information is passed on.

As for what this method is well quite simply it‚Äôs to bet a series of accumulator bets on long term markets during the season .

I do of course realise that accumulators are very much thought to be very unprofitable. 
And in fact I have been told the way I bet is impossible to win from long term by respected professional gambler Tony Ansell, countless people on forums and even two Cambridge educated mathematicians one of whom showed me a formula that ‚Äòproved‚Äô I was wrong .

However it is the experts and mathematicians who are wrong.

In their arrogance they completely overlook more than one crucial aspect of such bets when they are applied to long term markets in volume.

And that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt feel I need to elaborate at this stage since the aim of this email is merely to make many smart responsible people aware of this incredible situation especially as I‚Äôve included ample evidence to at least prove I‚Äôve won a large amount of money over many years and since I‚Äôm more than willing to prove this under laboratory conditions or to provide enough basic advice that should enable some of you to be able to make a profit from such bets within two years of practising and observing the markets.
Oh and I‚Äôm very much aware of survivorship bias.


Except for one very important thing . 

In October 2020 a two year boy called Timothy underwent a very serious potentially life saving operation to remove a tumour from around his kidney at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.

It was a success. However sadly he suffers from a rare chronic illness called dancing eye syndrome that will almost certainly affect the rest of his life.

My will -which any journalist can check- currently leaves the whole of my estate to his very hard working devastated parents who have both already had very tough lives (in Poland and Slovakia).

However if by January 31st 2025 at the latest I have reason to believe I‚Äôm still not being taken seriously and that we are still years away from the truth about sports betting becoming known the whole of my estate will be spent on advertising my method of sports betting and the family will receive nothing. (Although I shall ask people to please donate a share of their winnings to them.)
And I will begin spending money on advertising this information from that date.


It‚Äôs very much not something I want to have to do but I will if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take since I very much believe it‚Äôs very important that people know the truth about gambling and I will have done everything I could think of to make people aware of my method before 2025 but apparently to no avail.

I am absolutely disgusted at the sheer scale of the hypocrisy, dishonesty and selfishness of gamblers.
They so clearly don‚Äôt give a damn about the truth. 
And are happy to encourage hundreds of millions of mainly poor people around the world to bet in a way they themselves can‚Äôt win at .

The idea that betting singles on matches is the best way to beat the bookies is one of the greatest CONS on the internet and I‚Äôm willing to spend every penny I have letting as many people know about it as possible if that‚Äôs what it takes.


 All they ever had to do was try betting accumulators on outright markets for very small stakes for enough of them to have have soon realised I‚Äôm probably right. But as I say they just don‚Äôt care about the truth.

In fact the idea that betting singles on games is the best way to win at sports betting for the overwhelming majority of gamblers is such an incredible lie that even if accumulators on outright markets aren‚Äôt a profitable way to bet on sport long term -which they are- they still give the average gambler a far better chance of a long term profit because they can still win by luck .

Whereas the effect of betting singles on games is to ensure that no amount of luck can make you a long term profit if you don‚Äôt hold a consistent edge over a long period  .
Which very very few gamblers ever do of course . And even if they did they‚Äôd be restricted by all European bookies long before they could exploit it.


It really is utterly incredible that no one seems to care about the extent of the dishonesty these people are exhibiting.

They clearly don‚Äôt give a damn how many mainly poor people lose money because of their advice and they make me utterly sick.





Here then is my evidence;",Email to journalists mathematicians sociologists psychologists and behavioural economists
2071,SoccerBetting,"I continue to be absolutely appalled by the staggeringly ignorant arrogant comments about sports betting to be found on this site and to be fair to Reddit elsewhere on the internet and in books .

By far the best way to win money from sports betting is to bet accumulators on outright markets and the selections in those bets do NOT need to be value and I do NOT need to bet at the best prices . In fact I just need a bet 365 account.

So appalled am I by the astonishingly bad irresponsible gambling advice online and the sheer arrogance of the people giving it most of whom have so clearly won nothing whatsoever from soccer betting that over the next four years I will be offering to show any newspaper, journalist, sociologist,  behavioural economist or mathematician exactly how ridiculously easy it is to win money from sports betting by doing one thing above all else .

The complete opposite of the utterly appalling advice to be found online . 

But that won‚Äôt begin for another several months as I want to win another ¬£1 million first .

In the meantime then if any Redditor or group of Redditors wishes to bet me a large amount of money I can‚Äôt make a profit doing nothing but accumulators or parlays with the odd double or treble near the end for hedging purposes and using only bet365 markets and prices I‚Äôm game .

We would draw up rules of course and it would be done under strict conditions.  Although not immediately as I have other priorities right now.

Strict conditions that would definitely make it significantly harder for me you understand. If I have my own account it‚Äôs ridiculously easy to beat bet365.

I mean ridiculously easy .

But typing out bet after bet to give to others to place is far harder . However I‚Äôm usually attempting to make 6 figures  minimum whereas here I‚Äôd just be making a small profit.


Anyway this is all academic because I have no doubt whatsoever you won‚Äôt take the bet.


Because the last thing any of you wants is the truth. Instead you encourage poor people around the world to bet in a way that in reality gives them no chance of coming out ahead.

It‚Äôs absolutely scandalous and that‚Äôs why as I say in a few months proof of most of my winnings and how I did it is going to every newspaper in the western world and to 1000s  and 1000s of sociology behavioural economics and maths departments of schools colleges and universities all over the world.

And Redditors will finally find out after they all have .

If however I‚Äôm still not taken seriously then the whole of my estate will be spent advertising the information long after I‚Äôm dead.



Meanwhile all I can expect on here is criticism instead of  your money . 


Never mind though . This is without doubt the most straightforward season of the last 24 years and I very much hope to win ¬£1 million despite having no accounts .

Heh ho .



If I don‚Äôt reply to any bet offers it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôve changed my mind, I‚Äôm moving house and have other things taking priority too.

Any such bet bet can probably be done at the same time as I show the journalists mathematicians sociologists and others show easy this is. But you can at least start up saving your money and and thinking about the rules eh ?

2133,SoccerBetting,"Hello everyone, first of all, I'd like to thank the community for helping me so far, I've been learning a lot by reading your opinions and the sub's guide/FAQ. I made some money with my first 30$, which I cashed out, but eventually I lost what was left and now I'm trying to study a bit more about soccer betting to come back with better chances of making some money. Therefore, I'd like to ask some questions, I'm sorry if I make any newbie questions. Please have in mind that my goal on betting is to make some side money in order to pump up my savings, any USD10 month would be good for me. With that being said, here are the questions. Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I know that only betting on accumulators is a bad strategy in the long term. But what about doubles and triples? And how do people choose the games for doubles and triples? Do they put legs for the same market and games that start at the same time?
2. Is it possible to make safe bets on the same bookmarker? For instance, betting on 1, X and 2 and still profiting from the difference in the odds.
3. I usually bet on the match winner, but there are people who only bet on BTTS, corners, cards, etc. Is there a safer market for beginners even if it is less profitable than other options?
4. I once won a 20.0 odds bet with bet365 custom bet option. This is a feature that lets you choose a lot of markets for the same match, as an accumulator, so I got both results, scorers, corners, etc right. I kept betting like this but I eventually noticed that it is really hard to get multiple results right for the same match. So, is it safer to restrict betting on a single match to a single market like final score or BTTS? Some matches have really low odds for the winner like some Bayern games, so adding corners and goals seem like a good strategy to get better odds.
5. I have read that people either specialize in a single market for a lot of games (i. e. betting on BTTS on matches from various leagues) or in a single league (i.e. someone that only bets on La Liga). As a beginner, which one is usually easier? And if I end up specializing in a specific league, would it be easier to bet on famous leagues (that, therefore, have more information) or less known leagues?
6. I know that the lower the odds, the higher the chance of the bet winning. But is there an optional odd minimum for a safe bet? I read somewhere that good bettors only bet on 1.8-2,2 odds. I find it especially hard to predict the outcome of matches where both teams have similar odds for a certain market, like 2.36 for 1 to win and 2,67 for 2 to win. Any good strategies in this case or is it better to simply avoid this match?
7. Considering that I have a low goal for monthly profits, how much should I be betting with each stake? For instance, if I deposit 50$ in my local currency and I want to make 30$ out of that in a single month, how much should I put in each bet?
8. Lastly, how long did it take you to start making money with soccer betting?",Some questions from a beginner

Even if reports aren't true Liverpool do have a history of fielding weakened squads in the League Cup so it is very likely they will tomorrow night. [https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-backed-win-trophies-season-25756844](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-backed-win-trophies-season-25756844)

&amp;#x200B;

Another match to look out for is Brentford vs Chelsea. Brentford are 3/1 to win against Chelsea who are in poor form and their squad are depleted by COVID and failed to fill a full bench vs Wolves. Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has said that he may have to play Academy players against Brentford and I can imagine Chelsea putting out a very weakened XI as they'll prioritise their League game four days later which looks like a must win for them to stay in the title race. If you want to assume both Liverpool and Chelsea will play very weak sides the odds of a Leicester and Brentford double is 16.6/1.

2151,SoccerBetting,"Hello, recently I came across footy stats X under goal strategy. I was surprised that they even had a low odds strategy because I know that low odds betting is looked badly on but how they explained it sounded pretty good. The strategy is for example if the score is 1-1 by the the 57-60 min mark to bet the under 5.5 goals essentially giving you a 4 goal under cushion, and if a 2 goals are scored by the 82min mark to cash out. They say the point of this strategy is ""to never lose"" the problem is no books are going to offer a under 4 goals cushion at the 60 min mark , the best you can get is a under 3 goal cushion. So what I tried is the equivalent by waiting by the 70 min mark, and betting a under 3 goal cushion, for example if the score is 2-0 I take the under 4.5 and try to cash out if a goal is scored by the 80 min mark. The only thing is whenever a goal is scored most of the books suspend the cashout option most of the time if a goal is scored by that time mark. Footy stats said you can profit over 2k in a couple of weeks using this strategy. Wonder if any one else have tried this strategy? Kind of in a rush writing this getting ready for work. Sorry for the typos.",Footystats X under goal low odds strategy

Hi guys, I hope everyone is doing great. I have been searching for value betting methods a quite some time, and I decided to give it a go. I played for almost a week with this method, and I have a small profit percentage. According to what I have read, you need to be patient and not give up easily to gain profit in the long run.

So my questions are these:

1- Is anyone familiar with the value betting method?

2- What are the cons and press for this method?

3- Do you know any good and not expensive value bet finder software? :)

Note: For those who don't know what value betting is, basically, the system you find the overprice for the betting. For example, in Barcelona- Real Madrid, every bookie gives home @ 2, but bet365 gives home 2.10, called value bet.",Value betting

2158,SoccerBetting,"  

Hi All!

Wish to come back to soccer betting after a break with rather unsuccessful record in 2021. With a clean mind, intention to paper bet few times in the coming days to get the grasp of it again and monitoring this sub closely!

I enjoy reading your strats and analysis and I am curious what would be your attitude to the following issue. I live in a jurisdiction where I have to pay tax while betting. This tax is paid based on the bet ‚Äì 12% of the bet so it is a disadvantage from the beginning as effectively I only bet 0.88 of my bet unit. Quick example would be finding value in 1.76 odds bet ‚Äì placing 1 unit and winning should yield me 1.76 units. Under this taxation regime my expected yield is actually 1.76\*0.88 giving effective odds of 1.55. 

While to be affected by this purely in money terms I need to win bets first however I wonder if it affects the bets screening and choosing process. Reviewing my past bets and knowing that my effective odds are lower I wonder if I made a few mistakes previously looking for higher odds to compensate the tax without changing betting unit, adding one more bet to parlay that was not successful etc even without knowing if this was the case. 

This is probably not the crucial factor that decides if you win or not but I am curious what would be your take in such instance, if you would even consider it or do not change strategy at all. Thanks!",Taxation affecting bets

2166,SoccerBetting,"Hi all! Hope you're having a good sunday! üòÑ

I want to share an idea I have. Nothing spectacular but I think it would be fun and inexpensive betting strat. 

Picking 3 matches and betting BTTS both halves on all 3 as accumulator. BTTS both halves odds vary from as low as 7.00 to as high as 15.00 and therefore on the accumulator of 3 total odds can vary from 1000 to 2000 or so.

Two rules tho: 
1. Stake is lowest possible, 0,5 euros for example. 
2. This accumulator is done only once a week, preferably weekend league games. 

On average, 0.5 euros would return around 700e. Betting this once a week would mean that around 25 years would have to pass for a winning bet not giving profit. With bad luck, this strategy would cost some 25 euros a year.

BTTS both halves games happen and they happen a lot. Bundesliga would be main source but I wouldn't run from any other league. 

If more people like this idea I would suggest something like making a thread every friday where people can discuss, suggest or look for btts both halves bets to tail. If separate thread is too much, a comment thread on friday/saturday daily thread would do as well.


I believe this is fun and inexpensive and solid chances to hit every now and then returning big profit for just 50 cents.

# The HT over/under goal markets 

&amp;#x200B;

Just from this weekend alone, out of 50 matches in the European leagues I follow (EPL, Serie A, Bundesliga, Eredivisie, Ligue 1 and La Liga) that were played or are playing at the time of writing, 24 matches finished the first half over 1.5 goals.  The pre-match odds for this pick typically range from 1.90 (most likely) to 2.75 (least likely but still possible).  

It can be quite easy to predict in advance some of these games which can finish the first half with over 1.5 goals. I look for the following factors in the match-up:

* **Goals scored**: At least 1 team with strong attacking form (high average goals scored across their last 5 matches in the same competition, high xG and/or vastly overperforming their xG)
* **Goals conceded**: At least 1 team with weaker defense (high average goals conceded across their last 5 matches in the same competition, high xG-A or vastly underperforming their xG-A)
* **Each team's First Half Over 1.5 goals stats**: While past performance does not guarantee future performance, either or both teams having a high number of recent games with such an outcome against similar level of opponents suggests a higher chance of a similar outcome happening.
* **Team news**: Key attacking and defending players absent or present and their recent form.
* **Recent H2H matches in the same competition**: Certain fixtures just have goals, regardless whether both clubs are currently performing well or not.  Liverpool-Man Utd is one such fixture, or Bayern-Dortmund. With that said, it's important to consider the other factors stated and decide whether past H2H will influence the current match or whether those other factors will cause this match to fall under 1.5 instead.
* **Weather**: Heavy rain and snow reduce visibility and cause players to move and react less quickly than they usually do, both on and off the ball. The ball also tends to move slower on the pitch, which forces longer periods of ball retention and more long balls. Players tend to be less proactive in possession under such conditions, and this drastically reduces the chances of a first half with at least 2 goals, so always check the weather in advance.
* **Where to check stats**: **Flashscore** shows the club and player stats in each match listing. **Footystats'** match listings show each club's xG and xG-A for that fixture and what percentages of their total matches played so far in the season have ended over/under. **Forebet** shows the HT scoreline of each club's past fixtures; I find this useful for analysing H2H performance.

If after analysing these factors, you think the match's first half will fall under 1.5 goals, then I suggest  either going for the HT match result market, or choosing another market or match entirely. The odds for HT Under 1.5 have little value unless one team is expected to drastically over or underperform in attack or defence.

&amp;#x200B;

The flip side of the HT goal market is the Under, which for the 2.0+ odds we want, is the HT Under 0.5 goals pick.

Depending on the teams involved, this market can be trickier but also potentially very easy to land.  Choosing the right matches and teams with strong defensive form and stats is crucial for getting this pick correct, even more than the Over market.

For the first half Under 0.5 pick, you need the first half to end 0-0. The factors that are favourable to this are essentially the same as above, but flipped. I.e Teams with low xG and xG-A, teams with a low average of goals scored/conceded recently, teams who score more of their goals in the second half (like Man Utd) and key attackers being absent for the match.

&amp;#x200B;

I choose to focus on the Over 1.5 and Under 0.5 line because this are the most common lines which bookmakers have and are also the lines which most matches statistically fall over/under in the first half.

I write this because I observe that many of the picks people post here are for the match result or handicap markets, and often choose the match favourite (as set by the bookmakers). 

This is fine if there is clear evidence that justifies the match favourite being the match favourite, but as we all know, there are games the pre-match favourite fails to win or clear the handicap for various reasons, and in my opinion, the proof is often there to be seen, and thus the incorrect pick could have been avoided. 

I hope this will be useful to each of you and when the next matchday comes, that this market will be a winning choice for you instead of risking cash on the results or handicaps of less predictable matches.",How to make more money: Choose the HT over/under goal markets (applies to pre-match betting)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to accounts you something. I am thinking of adopting a both teams to score strategy as I personally believe it is better to get as much stats and work out formulas for a specific choice rather than select many choices to bet on.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, do you think that the reasoning for both teams to score below would be right?

&amp;#x200B;

Team1: Home; Team2: Visitor

&amp;#x200B;

1. Get the %both teams to score for each time.
2. Get the %games that team 1 scores as home and the% that team 2 scores as visitors.
3. Get the %games that team 1 concedes a goal as home team and the % that team 2 concedes a goal as visitor.
4. Add both both teams to score and divide it by 2
5. Add both % games they score and divide it by 2
6. Add both % games they concede goals and divide it by 2
7. Add all the percentages and divide them by 3

If result is over 50% then you can consider other variables that are less numbered related as climatology.

Does it make any sense from a mathematical/statistical/probability perspective?

Does anyone try to hedge bets for correct score of games? Why or why not?

Since sports gambling became legal in MI this past January I've been hedging bets on correct score of games. EPL and UCL, and I did some Euro this past summer. So far I am in the red (barely, in terms of a money wagered to money lost ratio) with ~15 games bet on at various stages of the game, but I'd be in the black if I only bet on games I actually watched (I keep a spreadsheet). It seems that it is better to bet on games that will be close (I get burned on games that are mismatched usually, think Bayern/Lazio in UCL last season). 

Some things I have picked up so far:

-only bet on games you are watching, and watch the whole game to feel the pace of it
-evenly matched games are easier to predict than heavy favorite/underdog
-cashing out can either burn you or save you, I usually minimize my losses this way, even though it would have been a win in some scenarios.
-bet the lower end of the scoring and add new scorelines at halftime if necessary to minimize losses.

Any advice on how to better hedge on correct score? What would you recommend instead of hedging on correct score? What are some other ""safer"" types of bets to make that work out for you? I know that's a contradictory statement, it's gambling and it's not ""safe"", but what has worked out for you?

2319,SoccerBetting,"Hello,

When I place a bet for an accumulator and one of the games is postponed/cancelled, the team is removed from the acca and the odds are shortened to reflect that. Fairly obvious and no issues with this.

However, when I place a multiples accumulator bet and the same thing happens the odds are reduced, but I believe so should the stakes be reduced.

I place a bet every week for 8 teams, which pays out if any six of those teams win. I choose ¬£1 stake in the 6fold multiple option, and this equates to ¬£28 stake. Because there are 28 combinations of 6 teams winning. 

Last weekend one of the game were postponed (Wigan oxford).

Skybet advise that the multiples reduce so instead of needing 6 teams I only need 5. Seems fair enough at first. However a 5 fold multiple on 7 teams has only 21 combinations. So the stake would only cost ¬£21 rather than ¬£28. So not only can I win less, I also staked more. I wonder if I am missing something here or If I did infact donate my stake to skybet, they don't seem to think anything is wrong with it, however why would they.

2368,SoccerBetting,"**FC Barcelon** After the disastrous defeat to Benfica and Bayern in the first two game of Champions League group state, Barcelon beat Dynamo Kyiv twice at home and away. At present, they rank second in Group E with 6 points. If Barcelona lose to the Portuguese giants again, they risk being usurped by Benfica. Moreover, given that they face the leader Bayern in the final group game, they'd better win this game, not even a draw. Xavi's opening game as a new manager ended perfectly with a 1-0 victory over the Espanyol on Sunday. Barcelona have been unbeaten in their last four games and have scored goals in the last seven home games.

**Benfica** Although the 3-0 victory over Barcelona in the second game attracted attention, the two disastrous defeats in Bayern Munich greatly reduced Benfica's hope of winning a place in the knockout of the Champions League. If Benfica takes all three points and separates from Camp Nou, they will get the second place in the group, if fails, they will have to occupy a place in the Europa League. The visitors could afford to rest a number of their top players on Friday for their Taca de Portugal meeting with Pacos Ferreira and still got a 4-1 victory.

Xavi will certainly provide a more reliable defender for the game and ensure that the team are in the top two. Benfica will not be easily defeated and have good memories of their battle with Barcelona in September, but we still expect Xavi's rule to continue here in a perfect way.",FC Barcelona vs Benfica

2371,SoccerBetting,"I started writing this huge wall of text explaining how my bets missed, but I'm actually so tired of this sh*t, I'm broke and depressed, and I don't even think anyone in here actually cares how I lost my bets.

I've lost in every possible way in the past ~3 weeks, but most important, I dare say that more than 70 % of my bets were lost on a single event (usually a single goal). I should've tracked them just for the sake of it. I played mostly ""doubles"", so imagine that you toss a coin and you get heads/tail sequence for about 25/30 times let's say. That's how my bets went.


And I swear it, almost every single time that ""event 1"" was lost on the bet, event 2 was coming in, just so that I can be more frustrated. Just hours ago, Roma scores their 2nd goal in min 93', just so it's the 5th bet in 2 days that I lose on a single event. Can you imagine how that feels?


One CS:GO round; one tennis set; a team that never scored 3 times in the season vs one that never conceded 3 times, now it scores 4 (happened TWICE); teams that never went Over 4.5 in their games, when they meet it's exactly 5 goals; games where I need O2.5, and min 20 it's already 1-1, it ends 1-1; then games where I need max 3 goals, and min 40 is already 2-1, then loss again. I could go on like this, but truth is, I can't even remember all the ways I lost, it's ticket after ticket after ticket, almost each on ONE damn single event.


It feels like the whole f*cking Universe is against me winning at this crap. I won 2 times out of 30+ bets, losing everything in the process. I have a gambling problem, I am aware of it, and I am also aware that it's extremely hard to make money out of this, almost impossible. I.DID.NOT.WANTED.THAT. It came to a point where it was just ""me vs the fate"". Like how far can it go? How many more times will one goal extra or minus lose my bet?


Well the answer seems to be: forever. I had the exact same experience 6 months ago (when I stopped), and the EXACT one a year ago. Bet after bet after bet, lost ON A SINGLE F*CKING EVENT. This is the thing that gets me, that I'm so, so close every time (I don't bet high odds though), yet once again it's a loss.

And yes, I wrote a f*cking wall of text again, I'm really mad when I'm not depressed about this situation, and I wish I never ever restarted this sh*t. I can probably hit 15/30 events in a single day, but if I bet them as ""doubles"", they will be on different bets and I'd lose them all. It's honestly like a curse.","I need to share my betting experience past few weeks, because it certainly feels I'm cursed"

Striker Salah is in amazing form and is at the top of the Premier League scorer list this season with 10 goals and 24 shots. But there are many wounded in the team currently, including Firmino, Naby Ke√Øta, Milner.

Arsenal beat Leicester City 1-0 away in the last round of League. The team have played a wave of four consecutive victories with a comprehensive recovery. With the recent upsurge of grabbing points, Arsenal have returned to the top five of the Premier League, with only 2 points left from the top four. They have achieved 8W-2D in the last 10 events. Emile Smith has scored four goals this season and has scored goals in the national team and league recently. However, players like Xhaka and so on are still injured and the team lineup is not complete.

In the last five Premier League meetings between the two teams, Liverpool maintained an absolute advantage of 4W-1L. Liverpool also beat Arsenal home and away last season. In addition, they occupy the home advantage in this game. So overall, in the cheers of the home fans, Liverpool have a good chance to win.

At present, they rank 16th in the table with 2W-3D-6L and accumulate 9 points, which are deeply in the relegation zone. The two main strikers Hahn and Caligiuri have not found the state so far and both of them have no harvest. However, the team have remained unbeaten at home in the recent three leagues and grabbed 7 points, performing well at home and showed signs of recovery in offense stability.

The team have scored 32 goals in nearly 8 home games, averaging as many as 4 goals, which shows the fierce offense. Lewandowski has scored 21 goals in various competitions this season. Muller is also in excellent condition recently for having handed over four assists and scored one goal in the last two rounds of the league. However, the main guard S√ºle has made it clear that he will not renew his contract with the team, and the performance of the defense line of the team may fluctuate. A number of players in the array left the team to participate in the national team competition, and their physical reserves will suffer a lot.

2414,SoccerBetting,"Finland vs France is a weird matchup. France dominated each of these matchups + also having more goal scoring attempts, SOTs etc. The latest one ended 2-0 victory for France, but the matchup before that ended to Finland winning 2-0 with odds @ 20.00. France heavily dominated that matchup aswell, but they weren't able to score. 

Now France has already qualified, and Finland hasn't. This is the most important matchup for Finland, and they have to press high. France are expected to make some changes as it isn't as important matchup for them. That's why they have odds @ 1.70 currently. But I still found it interesting since they have world class / quality players even with a rotated squad. And Finland should not be able to compete even against that rotated squad. 

But the most questionable thing is that the all top tier players has been [seen](https://twitter.com/equipedefrance/status/1460304457862987781) at Finland. Mbabbe, Benzema, Griezzman, Kante etc. And currently bookies are also giving France some crazy odds too on asian lines.

2444,SoccerBetting,"Hello guys, 

Rookie here. I'd love to have your feedback on my first bet as I feel it's easy to screw it up when starting. I've decided to go with a very small bankroll as I've read it's the wise way to go. I'm planning to bet on a few upcoming WCQ matches via an online bookie. I've heard it's not the best league to go for for value (why is that?) so I'm going with a 3 combined bets to spice things up a bit right away! (what could go wrong, heh?). I'll stick with those matches for now as these are the ones I will watch live and enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the bets I'm intending to place:

France - Kazakhstan / 1 @ 1.05 (over 1.5 not avail. unfortuantely)

Italy - Switzerland / 1 + over 1.5 @ 1.90

Belgium - Estonia / 1 + over 1.5 @ 1.08

Total odds: 2.15

&amp;#x200B;

Do you consider this a good value? Do you think I have a reasonable % of chance to win? (teams I've picked are clear favorites)

**Liverpool:** 

* J. Milner, N. Keita and H. Elliot confirmed to be out. 
   * Fabinho back? - Big boost for Liverpool then.
* Liverpool has scored an insane amount of goals in their previous matches. Their xG for this matchup is @ 2.04. 
* They played poorly against Brighton in the last weekend; Different momentum to UCL? Home ground advantage, stadium full of Liverpool fans?
* Salah to continue his insane form? Salah ATGS @ 2.00? 
* Last time they faced Atletico, they first scored the two goals, but then they conceded really fast the next two goals. Griezmann got the red card --&gt; Shifted to momentum advantage for Liverpool. The winning goal scored by Salah from Penalty at the 78th minute. What would have happen without the red card? Would it have been a draw? (2-2)

**Atletico Madrid**

* **A. Griezmann**, T. Lemar, M. Llorente, I. Saponjic, S. Savic confirmed to be out. Everyone but Saponijc has had some field time. Griezmann having the most impact for Atletico.
* Atletico won Real Betis 3:0 on their previous encounter. What is the situation now, since the opponent is so much better? Suarez, Correa, Carrasco and Trippier needs to have a perfect game to be able to compete with Liverpool at home. 
* Liverpool has had their shaky moments, so we can probably expect Atletico has some shots on target aswell. Also since they conceded a goal against Brighton, why wouldn't Atletico score aswell?

Odds are respectfully favouriting Liverpool, but what is the ""best"" market for this matchup? I'm kinda liking the Liverpool TT o1.5 goals @ 1.65, but the odds aren't great. 

Mo Salah ATGS @ 2.00 also got my interest, because his crazy form lately and he is also the penalty shooter for Liverpool.",Liverpool vs Atletico Madrid pre-game speculations

How common is it that a player who's currently in 4th, 5th or 6th place (or lower) moves up to end up winning top goalscorer of the season?

[Wolves VS Everton](https://www.goalooin.net/match/h2h-2027889) **---- Wolves Win @ 2.20**

In terms of history, Wolves have won 2, drawn 3 and lost 5 of the last 10 meetings with Everton. Among them, the last two meetings have suffered defeats, in the psychological underdog. However, the teams recent situation is even better, Asian Handicap Odds for the Wolves made -0.25 mid-high start, later adjusted to -0.25 mid-low.

The team is also in the midst of a five-game home winning streak. Now that they are at home again, it is not a problem for them to win.

[Levante VS Granada CF](https://www.goalooin.net/match/h2h-2038447) **---- Levante Win @ 1.95**

As the strength difference between the two sides is not big. But considering that Levante is sitting on the home ground, the team has already played out its strength in the last match, it is not too much to pursue victory in this match, plus the data support is good. On the contrary, Granadas away game is limited. On the whole, Levante is worth looking forward to.

‚öΩÔ∏è**Italian Serie A**

[Bologna VS Cagliari](https://www.goalooin.net/match/h2h-2053419)**---- Bologna Win @ 1.70**

As for the recent situation, Bolognas form is bad, but it has returned to winning track through the cup, and the extent of recovery remains to be seen. Cagliari, on the other hand, is in a stable form with 3 consecutive wins, but the teams weakness is the lack of away game ability. The data starts with Bologna -0.5 and then adjusted to -0.75.

Hi guys. There would be a way to make some free bucks if you want to try. By taking advantage of a crypto casino entry bonus.

1. Register using this link to get the bonus

&amp;#x200B;

2. Deposit $ 50 in USDT, ETH, BTC, Litecoin or BNB

3. You will receive an additional $ 50 bonus

4. You can withdraw the initial $ 50 back and only the $ 50 bonus will remain on the site. I tested it and I got my money back.

5. There is a x30 rollover before you can withdraw the other $ 50 bonus.

I was able to make about $ 200 ... then I lost everything by betting on roulette ... but maybe you will be luckier than me.

2564,SoccerBetting,"Ole is down to 1.25 to go and at a ""normal"" club you'd expect him to be off. But the given the backing he has received from the board, and ultimately they're more bothered by profits than results, he could easily stay the season. Plus there's no obvious contender to come in. 

This shift means there's some decent prices to be had on others. Sky have Farke at 5.50, which for a manager bottom with 2 points seems generous however Norwich seem content to be a yoyo club so seem like they will stick with him. Tempting but I'll pass. 

For me hassenhutl looks a big price at 34. Only 4 points above relegation zone and next games are Chelsea, Watford and villa. Poor results could see them in the bottom 3 right in sacking season.

Ajax VS dortmund: I think Dortmund will take this always a chance with Haaland and reus on the pitch, ajax great team but dont think they have the quality to beat dortmund.

I personally don't remember worst CL matchup with less value then this. 

Besiktas - Sporting, total tossup. No value in anything imo. 

Brugge - City. City @ 1.29 is a hard no for me, not worth it. O2.5 @ 1.52? Also pass. Don't see any good value here. Probably City wins, probably with not many goals (but it is City, so could also be trashing), but no value. Could as well end 1-1 or 1-0... 

Ajax - Dortmund Only of 2 games i will probably bet on with O 2.5 @ 1.5, but odds are dropping.  Also Dortmund is more likely to win imho, but too close&amp;uncertain to call. 

Atletico - Liverpol. Yes, Liverpool looked amazing vs Watford, but this is not watford. If i had to bet i would still probably chose LIV, but will pass, again too close to call. 

Inter-Sherrif. Fuck this cancer of a game. Sherrif will do what they did vs Shaktar and real, sit in penalty area and counter. Who the fuck knows how this ends??? 5-0 , 0 - 0 , 0-1 all equally possible.

PSG - Leipzig, second game i will again put on O 2.5 @ 1.5, odds dropping fast Just think it will be open game with goals. 

Porto - Milan, another total tossup. Anything is equally possible here. 

Shaktar - Real. If i had to bet it would be Real, but thank God i don't have to and i will pass. Nothing of any good value here also. Could go anywhere really with any score.

2682,SoccerBetting,"Just trying to understand more about how odds change throughout the opening line to the closing line. So once bookies set their opening line based off their complex algorithms/models, is it mainly the market that moves the odds from there, or do the models react to new information, e.g. lets say an important player was declared out a day before the game. 

Or is it based off both? 

Thanks!",Are odd changes based off market behaviour or bookies?

I've created a series of pages/tools to help find good bets for upcoming fixtures, ordered by % of something happening - such as BTTS, or home win, draw etc.. this is calculated using algorithms - and Ive had some success with using this as a starting point when making my specuilative accas on a weekend.

Please take a look, hopefully useful for someone - its totally free FYI

Also made a unique tool - which I havent seen before, to see fixtures with the biggest 'gaps' between the two teams based on specific stats (you can chose) - ie: if team A has scored 10 goals - and TeamB has scored 1 - that gap score is '9' etc.. you can factor in/out the scroes based on home/away advantage, of just use overall.

2853,SoccerBetting,"I'd like to have a little risk free bet on this game on Boylesports up to ¬£10 back as free bet on losing bets but it has to be a single.

I really don't think Spurs will win but then again Chelsea have been involved in a lot of low scoring games 1-1 or 0-1 possible here 

But  Spurs are missing key players like son and their defence is trash,they will be relying on Kane and Ali to spark something against a solid Chelsea.

It's possible Lukaku could thrive here and I'm tempted to maybe go for a Chelsea handicap win maybe -2 but not convinced  at the same time.

There's nothing much more of value here for a single bet unless going for a spurs win.

2959,SoccerBetting,"I've always found it useful to have a metric for ""match difficulty"" when calculating odds. For example, if I'm using stats such as ""goals scored/conceded in the last X matches"" in my model then I also need to take into account how difficult the previous fixtures have been e.g. if many goals have been conceded in the last five it tells a different story if those teams are all mid/lower table than if they are Man City/United, Liverpool and Chelsea.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I've incorporated this up to now is to calculate the probabilities of a win from average bookmakers odds, and compare this to the average probabilities of a win for that team over the previous season (home and away treated separately). I then adjust the various stats based on a related correction factor I calculate from this ratio. This gives better predictive power in the ML learning models I use than using uncorrected values.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the above approach due too the simplicity and also the availability of match odds for almost all global games. However, I'm interested in using an ELO system e.g. the one here ([http://clubelo.com/](http://clubelo.com/)) looks excellent. Does anyone think it is worth scraping/calculating such data points for the purposes of adjusting predictive stats in models?  It would be considerable effort to incorporate this but has the advantages of not relying on bookmakers odds when my model are looking to calculate more accurate odds than the bookmakers (although I never try to predict the match outcomes themselves). Anyone have experience of doing this? Worth the effort?",Elo vs match odds probabilities: which is better for assessing match difficulty?

3006,SoccerBetting,"hi,

i have been looking at odds boosts as a way to make some (easy) money and was wondering if other people look for these also.

say there is a boost for a team acca like yesterday (leicester, west ham, aston villa) all to win. odds were 8.0 on sky and if you take the betfair odds for the 3 you would get to around 6.5

obviously it didnt come in this time but if you only take ones with favourable odds it will be profitable in long run.

anyone else do this?

there is usually also anytime goal scorer boosts and anytime goalscorer accas. the odds for these are usually harder to find as liquidity on betfair is low. 

any other sites people use to compare these?

today there was boost of bamford AGS to 3.0 and betfair was 2.8x when i looked. but the spread on back/lay is usually quite large. so do people take the back or lay to compare? or better sites for this?",oddsboosts

3080,SoccerBetting,"Greetings,

I don‚Äôt know if this story of mine might be of your interest, but here goes: I‚Äôve made around ‚Ç¨17,000 in two weeks (!) betting on the Champions and Europa Leagues, starting from no more, no less than ‚Ç¨300. 

To prove my words, I invite you to check the Golden Boys Challenge rankings for this week and the one before on Winamax, the French betting platform that I use. (https://www.winamax.fr/en/sports-betting_golden-boy_rankings) You will find me there by the name ‚ÄòTokijin‚Äô. Furthermore, I will link to various screenshots of the bets I made throughout this post.


I would like to start by thanking all of you for your daily prognostics and thoughts about the upcoming games. I am not one to follow others blindly; I prefer to form my own opinion. Still, your input is highly welcome, and it certainly helps me consolidate my feelings regarding certain games.


My journey in football betting started in early 2019, when I made it to the Golden Boys Challenge ranking with about ‚Ç¨6,000 in gains. These gains were acquired through betting on the Champions and Europa Leagues. I continued betting through the 2019-2020 season; unfortunately, I lost a large portion of my initial gains. Still, I had gained some more by betting on the Women‚Äôs World Cup. I think I am simply better at betting on European and international competitions than at betting on the domestic leagues.


My current streak started about two weeks ago with this bet. (https://i.imgur.com/qOLCj0o.jpg) Everything was going well until the FC Basel ‚Äì Eintracht Frankfurt game, which made me quite anxious because Basel had 4.00+ odds. I cashed out the bet, believing that I was happy with making more than three times my initial wager. 

A few minutes after cashing out, I felt the regret. I was convinced that there was a good reason I bet on Basel or Draw, as Frankfurt had not been remarkably successful away compared to home.
It was then I decided to bet ‚Ç¨500 out of my ‚Ç¨1,033 on Basel DNB at 2.25 odds, which were too high for me to pass. My thought process was that, even if I lost the ‚Ç¨500, I had secured my initial wager + some profit. I took the shot and it went through. I was so happy. (https://i.imgur.com/INYztI3.jpg)


At this point, I had just a little above ‚Ç¨1,600. I withdrew ‚Ç¨300 and decided to bet ‚Ç¨1,300. The potential gain was close to ‚Ç¨40,000. I had never bet that much ‚Äì I mean, it is a lot of money ‚Äì but I was confident about the upcoming matches. Everything went well until the Inter ‚Äì Leverkusen match, where my anxiety got the better of me and I decided to cash out half of the ‚Ç¨1,300 bet for ‚Ç¨4,000. (https://i.imgur.com/yhtXsxB.jpg)


So far, I had ‚Ç¨4,000 worth of benefits out of an initial bet of ‚Ç¨300 with the potential to earn ‚Ç¨19,000 out of the remaining bet. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äú I thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a roll!‚Äù I decided to go for another bet on the side. Since I was confident in Seville and Shakhtar going through, I decided to bet on their qualification to the next round. It went through, netting me another ‚Ç¨2,500. (https://i.imgur.com/0r5vY1t.jpg) 


While the other bet was ongoing, I decided to go for another one. This one was risky, stupid and it led to me losing no less than ‚Ç¨1,500 out of greed. No penalty for Atalanta ‚Äì PSG, and Atletico Madrid lost. (https://i.imgur.com/DuzvG1c.jpg)


The RB Leipzig ‚Äì Atletico Madrid match took place the day after the Atalanta ‚Äì PSG match. I was anxious for it, as I needed this last win in order to cash out my ‚Ç¨19,000. I was ecstatic. ‚ÄúNo way Atletico will lose against Leipzig,‚Äù I thought. In my wisdom, I decided to cash out after Atletico scored ‚Äì the score was, at that point, 1 ‚Äì 1. The cashout was still high since I had bet on their qualification and not their victory. I cashed out half the bet for ‚Ç¨4,500. The full cashout was ‚Ç¨9,000 - ‚Ç¨10,000 but I decided to take the risk. Atletico lost, obviously. (https://i.imgur.com/fZHIkpT.jpg)


Regardless, I had gained a total of ‚Ç¨9,500 from my first bet to this moment. I withdrew ‚Ç¨2,000 and decided to go all in on Bayern beating Barcelona. I mean, with odds of 2, I saw insane value in it, especially since Bayern is such a strong team. A struggling Barcelona would have no chance. 

The first few minutes were stressing and frankly awful. Afterwards, the Bayern goals started rolling. I was sitting on ‚Ç¨15,000. (https://i.imgur.com/HccFrJn.jpg)
It was a beautiful moment. I was relieved and proud of myself. ‚Ç¨17,000 worth of profit in two weeks. I had never done that before.

Since then, I made a few other bets that resulted in earning ‚Ç¨5,000 more, but I am not risking as much money as with the ‚Ç¨7,500 bet.

How did I do it? A bit of analysis and a bit of luck but most importantly I tried to limit my risk. Some people will say that you should never cash out, but I disagree. If I had not cashed out, I would have literally won nothing.

Thank you guys for everything, and as always, best of luck !","From 300‚Ç¨ to 17 000‚Ç¨, the importance of cashing out."

3175,SoccerBetting,"Good afternoon, 

Some of you will remember [my post last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoccerBetting/comments/ot71j1/betting_supplement_site/), outlining our website which looks to employ various, proven mathematical models to present the most likely outcome of sporting events in a digestible format. For each outcome, we display both the ‚Äòfair\_odds‚Äô from the sharp bookies and the ‚Äòbest\_odds‚Äô from the soft bookies, meaning you can identify and utilise any gaps between the two. 

My partner and I have taken your feedback onboard, and implemented some of the key features you asked for. One of our favourite ideas - the ‚ÄòBet of the Day‚Äô will follow in the next iteration of the site. 

We are excited to announce our site is now ready to use. Please bear in mind, this is our beta version and you guys are the first to see it, so constructive feedback is welcomed. 

Please note - due to the site being at such an early stage, we are still working to collate data so we can present our ROI and the effectiveness of our strategies across a multitude of leagues and competitions. 

Without further ado, please see the link below for the website. The ‚ÄòHow it works‚Äô page and our intro blogs should give you a more detailed understanding of what we are trying to achieve, and how you can get the best out of the site.

3250,SoccerBetting,"So I'm a beginner bettor trying to get better. I was wondering if the following live betting strategy is a good one and any advice on it:  

Let's say for team A 75% of their matches when they play at home result in o2.5 goals. And for team B 50% of their matches when they play away result in o2.5 goals. So the average is 62.5%. That means to make a profit using 62.5% Assuming no major changes to the starting line-up and no other major variables, I'd need to make a bet greater than 1.60 to have a positive expected value. So when I'm watching the game, I wait until the odds reach higher than 1.60 to place it.  

Has anyone ever tried this strategy and experienced positive things? Any better ways to modify this approach? Or is this an outright bad approach?",Is this a good live betting strategy?
3251,SoccerBetting,"Sorry, don't watch soccer, but I was on Bovada and happened to see this as the fine print under every game:

Soccer is 1 hour long plus stoppage time (which is just about the most ridiculous way of timing a game I've ever heard of, but I digress). So wouldn't it be 0-45 + stoppage and then 45-60 + stoppage? What is this 4/5/6 1st half minutes business? Why does the 2nd half stop at 49/50/51 minutes? What do these numbers mean?

This really has me perplexed. Like regardless of what it means, how could the 1st half be 5 and the 2nd half be 50? I can't think of any measurement of any kind in any sport where both halves wouldn't be equal.",What has 5 in the 1st half and 50 in the 2nd half? Apparently a soccer game. Explain.

So at half time, 2 of the markets look near certain, 1 was likely but not as certain (U42 throw ins, I think it was 16 or 17 at HT), but the other looked a likely failure (U5 goals in the Argentina game). The original bet was paying around 3:1.

So my options realistically were:

1. Cash out at half time for a loss of $2.
2. Bet an amount equal to the potential profit on O4 goals in the Argentina game - basically banking on those other 3 markets not failing if the U5 goals were to actually hold, and suffering a massive blow out if U4 goals held but another market failed.

Thoughts?

Spoiler: I cashed out, given that in Brazil's last game the throw in market bet was in a very similar half time position, yet the final outcome was literally the edge (41 throw ins exactly).

Cheers!",[Question] Best option in this situation?

3455,SoccerBetting,,Beat the drop 28/6/21
3456,SoccerBetting,"Hi all,

I have to share this one, because my goodness I don't think I've had a bet this tense in a long time. To set the stage: in my system, I can lose up to 5 or 6 bets before I have to 'reset' (which causes a decent hit to my bankroll) - and due to a pretty abysmal weekend with Aussie Rules Football, this bet was number 4 out of that maximum 5 or 6, so pretty important!

As such, I meticulously crafted a Copa America multi (bet 3 of my 'chain' was a Euro multi, that failed on account of the Netherlands getting a red card). With this one, I was only going to use markets that I could fairly assess as having a 100% strike rate until now, with the exception of at least 1 goal to be scored in the Brazil/Ecuador game (the other 5 lines I included were 100% in the scope of the tournament, meaning if you had bet on any of them in any game previously in the tournament it was a winner - the 1 goal one was 15/16 for the tournament, but 21/21 for games these teams had played since the start of 2020. Given that the 1+ goal market was still +value if you just looked at the scope of the tournament trends, I was happy to include it.)

So the multi ends up being as such:

Brazil/Ecuador: Under 41.5 Throw Ins / Under 13.5 Corners / Over 0.5 Goals  
Venezuala/Peru: Under 41.5 Throw Ins / Under 13.5 Corners / Over 8.5 Goal Kicks  
Total: 1.86 / 93.75% / +74.37%  


At half time, things were looking rosey. Both the overs had already hit, the games had 3 and 2 corners respectively, and 17 and 14 throw ins respectively. Obviously I'd prefer a few less throw ins in the Brazil/Ecuador game, but at least they'd need to 'improve' in the second half to make it fail. Things were looking so good that Bet365 were offering about 90-95% of my potential return as a cashout. I definitely considered taking it - it was close enough to a whole win in my system that I could start a new 'chain', which is a much nicer place to be than the fifth 'link' if this bet had failed - but it was looking good, and I wanted to see if I could squeeze a bit more money out of the cash out (I should not that I would have been giving up about $180 if I had cashed out).

Now, anyone that's seen the stats of the games knows why I was sweating bullets. Corners - they were fine. Venezuala and Peru were being champs and didn't get close. But Brazil and Ecuador? They went on a throw in frenzy. Throw after throw after throw after throw. My cash out amount was steadily dropping - I had told myself I could always cash it out at my stake amount if I felt it was too risky to keep it going, which would allow me to have a second go at the fourth 'link in the chain', as opposed to being on the fifth if it lost. But then, a little after 80 minutes, there were about 3 throw ins in quick succession. Suddenly, my cashout plummeted from a slight profit, to about 25% of my stake. They still had a few throw ins to work with, but cashing out wasn't much of an option any more.

By about the 89th minute, the two teams had hit the limit - 41 throw ins. One single more throw in, and I was cooked. They somehow made it through the next minute without a throw in - then 5 minutes of added time. Ok, that's not too bad! I've seen stranger things happen (sidestory - had a crazy NBA win a week or so ago when the Sixers and Hawks scored 13 points in less than 30 seconds to get me to the exact minimum points I needed). 5 minutes to not have any throw ins - from two teams that, over the past 45 minutes, had averaged more than 2 throw ins every 5 minutes. Every time the ball went near the boundary, I held my breath. As the minutes ticked by, my heart pounded harder and harder. Once the 5 minutes elapsed, I was praying for the ref to blow the whistle.

And then it happened. Full time. Somehow the two teams that got 24 throw ins in 44 minutes, couldn't get a single extra one in just over 6 - and I couldn't be happier for it. But more than happy, I'm just so relieved that I didn't get punished for my greed when the half time cash out was really quite generous when the Brazil/Ecuador game wasn't too far off the mark throw in wise at that point.",[Story] Sweating Bullets - Copa America Multi

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some toughts:

To begin with I believe that Denmark are to high of a favourite, they have played well don't get me wrong but they should not have that high of an value.

Italy is for me one of the favourites to win, expecting an easy win for them.

Portugal should have the upper hand on Belgium, Belgium was super close to a deafet to the Danes. Hazard is far away from 100%. The only two players that have the quality to change the game is in my opinion KDB and Lukaku. Compare that to the Portuguese and tell me that Portugal should not be the favourites.

1st time in this tournament the Spaniards will meet a decent enough team to bring the game to them. With players like Brozovic, Modric and Kovacic the midfield will finally be good enough to play through Spains high pressure. I believe this will be a very fun game to watch with many counter attacks.

The toughest game in the Round of 16 to predict, England - Germany. From what i've seen, England have underperformed immensely. I don't know what type of England we'll see but it does not look good for them. Germany have had a tough group stage, minutes away from elimination. Despite their performances Germany have looked more even in their games than the English have done. Therefore I am going for the Germans here.

Sweden have been kind of a dark horse so far. I think it will be extremely difficult for Ukraine to break down Sweden's defence, and offensively speaking Sweden are very dangerous. Sweden to qualify is the right choice for me.

Essentially, the title.

I think Bet365 is counting more than just fouls as their free kicks as they awarded my market before the fouls total hit it, so yeah, does anyone know a site where I can find accurate free kick stats for most big leagues and tournaments? If you also know of one for goal kicks that would be great; it seems like a market with great potential but without being able to see the stats I'm not willing to touch it. :-P

Alternatively, does anyone know what metric Bet365 uses to calculate free kicks? If I know what stats they're looking at I can probably sort it out myself.

3501,SoccerBetting,"Today I learned an extremely extremely valuable lesson that I wanted to share. Any veteran bettor is going to read this post and just completely laugh at how stupid I am. And that's okay. Anyways, here's what happened:  

So I only recently started betting for the first time ever (a week ago). And I was doing extremely well too. I started out with $144 in my account and I was making really stupid bets that I shouldn't be making (like literally betting my entire bankroll on 1-2 games). The thing is, those bets were hitting and very quickly I was building up my bankroll. Maybe you can call it beginner's luck? The pros would call it a recipe for disaster. Anyways... before the Brazil vs Colombia game, I was at $767.

So I said to myself okay, Brazil won't lose this game. They've been beating their opponents fairly comfortably for the past year or so and Colombia has been shitting the bed hard. Fuck it, let's go all in and put my entire bankroll on the line. ""This is a guaranteed win"", I said.  

10 minutes into the game, Colombia scores an absolute killer of a goal. I was shocked. Dumbfounded. And for the rest of the game, Brazil were playing like as if they were trying to throw away the game. Brazil even missed an empty net at one point. I was ready to take my losses and never place a single sports bet ever again.  

Brazil then ties it late in the game at the 78th minute with a very shady goal. A glimmer of hope, but with the way Brazil were playing I was literally on the verge of tears. I started saying your typical bettor biases: ""Of course the team that hasn't lost a game in a year is losing the moment I place a giant bet on them"", ""My team would have won had I not placed a bet on them"", etc. etc.    

It's the 90th minute and I basically accepted defeat at this point. I began packing my bags, so to speak. I *literally* came and unsubbed from /r/sportsbook and /r/soccerbetting and was just about to leave the subreddit discord until....

...10 minutes into added time (that's not a typo, a whole-ass 10 minutes was added because Colombia was arguing with the ref for a long time and were refusing to play after Brazil's shady goal) **AT THE VERY LAST SECOND OF ADDED TIME, BRAZIL SCORES AND WINS THE GAME**  

THERE IS A GOD. Oh my fucking god. I live to see another day. I cash out $1108 (https://i.imgur.com/b5A4IHQ.png). I come back and re-sub to these two subreddits.

To my surprise, all of them said that my account had been suspended and I am unable to make a new account with the same details. I managed to get through on William Hills online chat and the advisor gave me a scripted "" we have taken a decision to permanently suspend your account following all the necessary procedures, this decision is final, etc."" and then disconnected before I could ask any further questions. I haven't managed to get in contact with the other two (Paddy Power and Sky Bet).

I'm absolutely baffled by their decisions because as far as I remember I only made a William Hill account to take advantage of a free bet which it turned out I didn't like the T&amp;C's of and I have only used Sky Bet for Super Six about twice (no actual bets or money deposited. The Paddy Power account I used occasional and always made money but I was a relatively small amount and although I placed fairly safe bet's relatively frequently (still less than 100 bets in the history of the entire account) I didn't hedge or bet strange amounts so I can't believe that I've been flagged up as a potential professional gambler.

Is it possible that I have had my details stolen and someone has been placing bets on my account? I haven't seen any evidence of this on my email linked to the accounts or had any problems with online shopping/banking etc. Plus I have logged in to the three accounts very rarely over a number of years.

3670,SoccerBetting,"I'm not a fan of short-priced long term bets, so I'm looking for a few group, player or tournament bets at bigger prices. Figure there's a lot of different nationalities here so there's a fairly broad amount of knowledge on European football.

Here's a few of mine, along with the reasoning and odds:

Christian Eriksen - top goalscorer @101.00 

Denmark have a solid team, a relatively weak group and the ability to give any of the big teams a game on any given day. Eriksen, who is their penalty and free kick taker, has 36 goals in 103 games. That's incredibly good for a midfielder, and if Denmark do go deep, he's likely to be one of the forces behind that. If you can get an each way bet for five places, you'll get 20/1 for the place. 

Yilmaz - top goalscorer (EW) 

Coming of the back of a title-winning season with Lille, and of an age where this is his last crack at an international tournament, what appeals to me most about this bet is Turkey's mad recent record, with four six-goal games in their last ten. They've an experienced manager who's united what's often a fractured international group due to club rivalries, plenty of creative players who can assist, and a group where only Italy really look like contenders. Yilmaz will be keen to continue his league form, and I see Turkey as the team most likely to have high-scoring games.

Turkey to make the quarters: @3.75

See above for reasoning.

Ukraine to win their group @ 6.00

This is more based on Frank De Boer resembling the eight straight losses de Boer at Palace than the title-winning Ajax version, but with the current form of the Dutch and in spite of all three of their group games being at home, I couldn't back them at 1.50 to be group winners.  Ukraine have had competitive results against good quality teams recently, the Netherlands have been thrashed by Turkey and needed a last minute goal to grab a draw in a friendly with Scotland. Ukraine are comfortably the second best team in the group, so appeal at the prices.

Stuart Armstrong - Top Scotland goalscorer - 21.00

Admittedly a bit of a punt but with Scotland not having any real quality strikers, most of their goals are scored by midfield runners. John McGinn has grabbed most of these recently, but as such his price is shot. I think Armstrong who has consistently scored goals the previous five seasons, and got six from thirty in a struggling Southampton side last season, represents massive value at 20/1. Happy to take a punt at those odds.

Austria - lowest goalscorers - 21.00

Sorry Austria, but I just don't see it. They've struggled to score goals of late with none in their last three games and the Faroes are the only team they've beaten in the last six months. Obviously this relies on some of the smaller teams scoring at least one, but I think at the advertised odds on this market only Slovakia at 11.00 and Austria at 21.00 represent value.

__________________________________


Here's a few that intrigue me:

* **Patrik Schick** - Czech Republic - $3.25
* **Sasa Kalajdzic** - Austria - $3.50
* **Che Adams** - Scotland - $5.50
* **Xherdan Shaqiri** - Switzerland - $7.00
* **Ondrej Duda** - Slovakia - $8.50
* **Eljif Elmas** - Macedonia - $9.00
* **Bruno Petkovic** - Croatia - $9.50
* **Aaron Ramsey** - Wales - $11.00

**Schick** and **Kalajdzic** are both young, in-form frontmen who should lead the line for their respective countries - odds over $3.00 feel like good value in return. Similar can be said for **Che Adams**.

**Shaqiri**, **Elmas** and **Duda** are simply the most talented attackers on their respective teams.

Croatia could start any of Kramaric, Budimir or **Petkovic** up-front. Hell they might even rotate between the three! But I think the latter will get first crack at it, and if he can hang onto it, $9.50 is great value.

Last but not least, **Aaron Ramsey**. Wales are a weird team in a tough group, and Ramsey's coming off a strange season, but he thrives in this type of environment, and there are few midfielders in world football that are better in front of goal than a fit and firing Aaron Ramsey.",[Euro 2020] Top Team Goalscorer

3794,SoccerBetting,"So alot of sites have over/undr as the best sports bet to bet on, not just in football.

I get that it‚Äôs a bet of 2 choices, either you win or lose, which makes it ‚Äòeasier‚Äô per say, but so does asian handicap.

asian handicap also gives you a ‚Äòleeway‚Äô where you can win half or just lose half if the score isn‚Äôt fully in your way. It‚Äôs also heavily affected by team strength, so it‚Äôs easier to research upon, while over/undr is alot more of a toss-up (2 low scoring teams can go 2-1 any game, while a bad team is less likely to beat a good team).

So is over/undr really the best bet? and how so?",Is over and undr really the most profitable bet? what is its advantage over asian handicap?

3797,SoccerBetting,"I have only 1 month of experience. An coupon of 75‚Ç¨ made me trying to bet. Already lost 60‚Ç¨ of my money, so instead of free 75‚Ç¨, is more like 15‚Ç¨.      
     
It has been awful to bet, Villarreal and Chelsea surprised a lot of us. There also other unexpected scores, but South American football is the one that makes most of people lose their money. But, even though I won't put more money on this, I do will receive a 5‚Ç¨ bonus (only for Euro) and 50‚Ç¨ to any competition. Only rule here is each of bonus should be bet on a single/multiple of odd 2.00 or higher. I will try to play carefully here and bet on nations I do really know how they play and in favourites. I feel like this is the competition where I can actually return my money. If I win, I won't be on a loss at least and won't bet again.

1. Pick an outright winner for the Euro before it starts (min bet: 80‚Ç¨).

2. Get a free bet every time said team wins a game (value: 20‚Ç¨).

At face value, this seems like a decent deal: I figure I can pick a heavy favourite for 80‚Ç¨, use the first 4-5 free bets on easy -1000 bets in my sport to win my initial stake back, and everything from there is profit.

But, as I said, I know nothing about football: I don't know if there is an obvious team to pick for this to work, I don't even know if the teams play enough games for this to have a high chance of working out...

* Ingolstadt have the best home record in the 3. liga this season, with only one loss all season, and they won at home 3-1 last season in the 2. bundesliga relegation play off against Nuernberg 3-1. They are letting fans back in to attend this game also so home/away will have more of an advantage than just not having to travel for the game

* Ingolstadt are unbeaten in 8 games, and coming off a 5-1 away win, and a 3-1 home win (against 4th placed 1860 Munich that secured their playoff spot). Osnabrueck are coming off a 2-1 away loss against mid-table Aue (who had lost 3-8 and 0-3 in the 2 games prior to playing Osnabrueck). Osnabrueck were 1-0 ahead and could have avoided the relegation playoff if they had won, but bottled the lead

3952,SoccerBetting,"I live in Virginia and casually do some sport bettings. Won some, lost some. Fortunately so far I have made a small profit, less than $600. I learned that I have to pay federal and state taxes on these winnings.

Federally, I am allowed to deduct gambling losses on Schedule A (Itemized deductions). About the State of Virginia, on their Schedule A (Itemized deductions), I found the same thing.

Virginia's Schedule A link:

[https://www.tax.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/taxforms/individual-income-tax/2020/schedule-and-instructions-2020.pdf](https://www.tax.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/taxforms/individual-income-tax/2020/schedule-and-instructions-2020.pdf)

However, I am not sure whether Virginia allows gambling losses as itemized deductions.

Please help me clarify this. Thank you very much and any help is highly appreciated!",Does Virginia allow deduct gambling losses?

3972,SoccerBetting,"So I've been told by some friends of mine that sometimes it's easy to make money by betting on soccer matches (especially champions league I believe he said) and I have some questions.

Why does the over/under goals amount always end in .5?

When using unibet (or any other site I guess), do they take a percentage of your winnings? Like if I bet ‚Ç¨10 and I win ‚Ç¨15, do I actually get ‚Ç¨5? 

Oh and are there any bets that are almost always a guaranteed win?

Thanks",Some questions from someone who's new to betting

3975,SoccerBetting,"Hello. I placed a bet on Real Madrid to receive over 1.5 cards. Unibet insists that Real Madrid only got one card, one on Nacho Fernandez. From what i can see, Valverde got a card aswell, in the 91th minute. Can someone please confirm this because i'm confused. Maybe someone who watched the game?","Can someone please help me out here, how many cards did Real Madrid receive today against Bilbao? Conflict with betting company"
3976,SoccerBetting,"So I'm totally new to betting and has been doing this for less than a week.

what I did the first thing in the morning is go to my local betting website and scan through every game there is for the day. I then go on multiple betting tips site, collate as much info as I can then move towards my next step which is:

To bet a 4-fold on the 4 likeliest outcome of the day, based off the info gathered.

Then I proceed to split the day up and make bets within each time period. For example, the MLS starts in the morning, so based off my info, I'll throw multiples at numerous likely scenarios all within this period. I only bet on multiples, because I feel like single bets aren't worth it.

I know it isn't wise to bet periodically, but I feel like, if I bet 2 or more bets in different period of the day, I wouldn't know the results, to know how much to put on my next bet. For example, if I know the results for my morning bets and I win, I'll bet higher for my next bets. But if my 2nd outcome would only appear after the day is over, then I wouldn't know if I should raise my next bet.

Through this method, I realise it isn't sustainable as I'm consistently losing. I'll have a really good period where I get my funds back to it's original, then it'll start to consistently drop again.

what am I doing wrong? It's fun, but I feel like I'm not grasping the core to this.",I feel like I'm betting wrong..

3984,SoccerBetting,"I feel like betting under goals goes against everything that I love about football because you very rarely get to see good game with low scoring results but very often this is the best way for me to profit, especially later stages of the season when teams have already set their position on the table and can't be relegated or play European football next season. It just feels bad though because essentially what you're betting is that strikers can't do their job and I feel like under goals are very inflated as well due to everyone betting overs so if O2.5 goals is even, the likelihood of it happening is actually like 45% or something.

Does anyone else bet on under goals? How do you feel about this situation?",I absolutely hate betting on unders but it brings in the most profit for me.

Aussie A-League **Melbourne City vs Wellington Phoenix**

Melbourne City ML + Melb. over 5.5 corners @ 2.0 Unibet

Melbourne City over 7.5 corners @ 2.38 Unibet

Bet365 isn't offering team corners bet at the moment. Melbourne City averaged 8.66 corners in the last 3 games (9, 8, 9). Considering Wellington Phoenix defence (2 of 3 games finished 0:0) I'm expecting more than 10 corners in total.
